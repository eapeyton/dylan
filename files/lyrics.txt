one by one they followed the sun
one by one until there were none
two by two to their lovers they flew
two by two into the foggy dew
three by three they danced on the sea
four by four they danced on the shore
five by five they tried to survive
six by six they were playing with tricks
how many paths did they try and fail
how many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail
how much poison did they inhale
how many black cats crossed their trail
seven by seven they headed for heaven
eight by eight they got to the gate
nine by nine they drank the wine
ten by ten they drank it again
how many tomorrows have they given away
how many compared to yesterday
how many more without any reward
how many more can they afford

ive been deceived by the clown inside of me

the spanish moon is rising on the hill
but my heart is a-tellin me i love ya still

but me i cant cover what i am

i march in the parade of liberty
but as long as i love you im not free
how long must i suffer such abuse
wont you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose
ive given up the game ive got to leave
the pot of gold is only make-believe
the treasure cant be found by men who search
whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church
we sat in an empty theater and we kissed
i asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
my head tells me its time to make a change
but my heart is telling me i love ya but youre strange
one more time at midnight near the wall

as i walked out tonight in the mystic garden
the wounded flowers were dangling from the vines
i was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain
someone hit me from behind
ain't talkin' just walkin'
through this weary world of woe
heart burnin' still yearnin'
no one on earth would ever know
they say prayer has the power to help
so pray from the mother
in the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
i'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
but oh mother things ain't going well
ain't talkin' just walkin'
i'll burn that bridge before you can cross
heart burnin' still yearnin'
they'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
now i'm all worn down by weepin'
my eyes are filled with tears my lips are dry
if i catch my opponents ever sleepin'
i'll just slaughter them where they lie
ain't talkin' just walkin'
through the world mysterious and vague
heart burnin' still yearnin'
walking through the cities of the plague
the whole world is filled with speculation
the whole wide world which people say is round
they will tear your mind away from contemplation
they will jump on your misfortune when you're down
ain't talkin' just walkin'
eatin' hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town
heart burnin' – still yearnin'
someday you'll be glad to have me around
they will crush you with wealth and power
every waking moment you could crack
i'll make the most of one last extra hour
i'll avenge my father's death then i'll step back
ain't talkin' just walkin'
hand me down my walkin' cane
heart burnin' still yearnin'
got to get you out of my miserable brain
all my loyal and much-loved companions
they approve of me and share my code
i practice a faith that's been long abandoned
ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
ain't talkin' just walkin'
my mule is sick my horse is blind
heart burnin' still yearnin'
thinkin' ‘bout that gal i left behind
it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
fame and honor never seem to fade
the fire's gone out but the light is never dying
who says i can't get heavenly aid
ain't talkin' just walkin'
carrying a dead man's shield
heart burnin' still yearnin'
walkin' with a toothache in my heel
the suffering is unending
every nook and cranny has its tears
i'm not playing i'm not pretending
i'm not nursing any superfluous fears
ain't talkin' just walkin'
walkin' ever since the other night
heart burnin' still yearnin'
walkin' ‘til i'm clean out of sight
as i walked out in the mystic garden
on a hot summer day hot summer lawn
excuse me ma'am i beg your pardon
there's no one here the gardener is gone
ain't talkin' just walkin'
up the road around the bend
heart burnin' still yearnin'
in the last outback at the world's end

angelina

his eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
with a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
and the head of a hyena

if you can read my mind why must i speak
no i have heard nothing about the man that you seek
angelina
oh angelina. oh angelina
in the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
the peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed

your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same

oh angelina. oh angelina

begging god for mercy and weepin in unholy places

oh me and my cousin one arthur mcbride
as we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
mark now what followed and what did betide
for it bein' on christmas mornin'
now for recreation we went on a tramp
and we met sergeant napper and corporal vamp
and a little wee drummer intending to camp
for the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.
good morning good morning the sergeant he cried.
and the same to you gentlemen we did reply
intending no harm but meant to pass by
for it bein' on christmas mornin'
but says he my fine fellows if you will enlist
ten guineas in gold i'll stick to your fist
and a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
and drink the king's health in the morning.
for a soldier he leads a very fine life
and he always is blessed with a charming young wife
and he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
and he always lives pleasant and charmin'
and a soldier he always is decent and clean
in the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.
while other poor fellows go dirty and mean
and sup on thin gruel in the morning.
but says arthur i wouldn't be proud of your clothes
for you've only the lend of them as i suppose
but you dare not change them one night for you know
if you do you'll be flogged in the morning
and although that we're single and free
we take great delight in our own company
we have no desire strange places to see
although that your offers are charming.
and we have no desire to take your advance
all hazards and dangers we barter on chance
for you'd have no scruples for to send us to france
where we would get shot without warning
oh no says the sergeant.  i'll have no such chat
and neither will i take it from snappy young brats
for if you insult me with one other word
i'll cut off your heads in the morning.
and arthur and i we soon drew our hogs
and we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
when a trusty shillelagh came over their head
and bid them take that as fair warning.
and their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
we flung them as far as we could in the tide
now take them up devils! cried arthur mcbride
and temper their edge in the mornin'!
and the little wee drummer we flattened his bow
and we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
and bade it a tedious returning
and we havin' no money paid them off in cracks.
we paid no respect to their two bloody backs
and we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
and left them for dead in the morning.
and so to conclude and to finish disputes
we obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
for we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
and bid them look sharp in the mornin'.
oh me and my cousin one arthur mcbride
as we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
mark now what followed and what did betide
for it bein' on christmas mornin'

well frankie lee and judas priest
they were the best of friends
so when frankie lee needed money one day
judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
and placed them on a footstool
just above the plotted plain
sayin take your pick frankie boy
my loss will be your gain
well frankie lee he sat right down
and put his fingers to his chin
but with the cold eyes of judas on him
his head began to spin
would ya please not stare at me like that he said
its just my foolish pride
but sometimes a man must be alone
and this is no place to hide
well judas he just winked and said
all right ill leave you here
but youd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
before they all disappear
im gonna start my pickin right now
just tell me where youll be
judas pointed down the road
and said eternity!
eternity said frankie lee
with a voice as cold as ice
thats right said judas priest eternity
though you might call it ‘paradise
i dont call it anything
said frankie lee with a smile
all right said judas priest
ill see you after a while
well frankie lee he sat back down
feelin low and mean
when just then a passing stranger
burst upon the scene
saying are you frankie lee the gambler
whose father is deceased
well if you are theres a fellow callin you down the road
and they say his name is priest
oh yes he is my friend
said frankie lee in fright
i do recall him very well
in fact he just left my sight
yes thats the one said the stranger
as quiet as a mouse
well my message is hes down the road
stranded in a house
well frankie lee he panicked
he dropped evrything and ran
until he came up to the spot
where judas priest did stand
what kind of house is this he said
where i have come to roam
its not a house said judas priest
its not a house . . . its a home
well frankie lee he trembled
he soon lost all control
over evrything which he had made
while the mission bells did toll
he just stood there staring
at that big house as bright as any sun
with four and twenty windows
and a womans face in evry one
well up the stairs ran frankie lee
with a soulful bounding leap
and foaming at the mouth
he began to make his midnight creep
for sixteen nights and days he raved
but on the seventeenth he burst
into the arms of judas priest
which is where he died of thirst
no one tried to say a thing
when they took him out in jest
except of course the little neighbor boy
who carried him to rest
and he just walked along alone
with his guilt so well concealed
and muttered underneath his breath
nothing is revealed
well the moral of the story
the moral of this song
is simply that one should never be
where one does not belong
so when you see your neighbor carryin somethin
help him with his load
and dont go mistaking paradise
for that home across the road
sad im a-sittin on the railroad track
watchin that old smokestack
train is a-leavin but it wont be back
years ago we hung around
watchin trains roll through the town
now that train is a-graveyard bound
where we go up in that north country
lakes and streams and mines so free
i had no better friend than he
something happened to him that day
i thought i heard a stranger say
i hung my head and stole away
a diesel truck was rollin slow
pullin down a heavy load
it left him on a utah road
they carried him back to his home town
his mother cried his sister moaned
listenin to them church bells tone
hollis brown
he lived on the outside of town
hollis brown
he lived on the outside of town
with his wife and five children
and his cabin fallin down
you looked for work and money
and you walked a rugged mile
you looked for work and money
and you walked a rugged mile
your children are so hungry
that they dont know how to smile
your babys eyes look crazy
theyre a-tuggin at your sleeve
your babys eyes look crazy
theyre a-tuggin at your sleeve
you walk the floor and wonder why
with every breath you breathe
the rats have got your flour
bad blood it got your mare
the rats have got your flour
bad blood it got your mare
if theres anyone that knows
is there anyone that cares
you prayed to the lord above
oh please send you a friend
you prayed to the lord above
oh please send you a friend
your empty pockets tell yuh
that you aint a-got no friend
your babies are crying louder
its pounding on your brain
your babies are crying louder now
its pounding on your brain
your wifes screams are stabbin you
like the dirty drivin rain
your grass it is turning black
theres no water in your well
your grass is turning black
theres no water in your well
you spent your last lone dollar
on seven shotgun shells
way out in the wilderness
a cold coyote calls
way out in the wilderness
a cold coyote calls
your eyes fix on the shotgun
thats hangin on the wall
your brain is a-bleedin
and your legs cant seem to stand
your brain is a-bleedin
and your legs cant seem to stand
your eyes fix on the shotgun
that youre holdin in your hand
theres seven breezes a-blowin
all around the cabin door
theres seven breezes a-blowin
all around the cabin door
seven shots ring out
like the oceans pounding roar
theres seven people dead
on a south dakota farm
theres seven people dead
on a south dakota farm
somewhere in the distance
theres seven new people born
i once loved a girl her skin it was bronze
with the innocence of a lamb she was gentle like a fawn
i courted her proudly but now she is gone
gone as the season shes taken
through young summers breeze i stole her away
from her mother and sister though close did they stay
each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
of the two sisters i loved the young
with sensitive instincts she was the creative one
the constant scapegoat she was easily undone
by the jealousy of others around her
for her parasite sister i had no respect
bound by her boredom her pride to protect
countless visions of the other shed reflect
as a crutch for her scenes and her society
myself for what i did i cannot be excused
the changes i was going through cant even be used
for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose
the could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
with unknown consciousness i possessed in my grip
a magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped
noticing not that id already slipped
to a sin of loves false security
from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
answers of emptiness voice vacancies
till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but please
whats wrong and whats exactly the matter
and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
the timeless explosion of fantasys dream
at the peak of the night the king and the queen
tumbled all down into pieces
the tragic figure! her sister did shout
leave her alone god damn you get out!
and i in my armor turning about
and nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness
beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound
her sister and i in a screaming battleground
and she in between the victim of sound
soon shattered as a child neath her shadows
all is gone all is gone admit it take flight
i gagged twice doubled tears blinding my sight
my mind it was mangled i ran into the night
leaving all of loves ashes behind me
the wind knocks my window the room it is wet
the words to say im sorry i havent found yet
i think of her often and hope whoever shes met
will be fully aware of how precious she is
ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me
how good how good does it feel to be free
and i answer them most mysteriously
are birds free from the chains of the skyway
you walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you say who is that man
you try so hard
but you dont understand
just what youll say
when you get home
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
you raise up your head
and you ask is this where it is
and somebody points to you and says
its his
and you say whats mine
and somebody else says where what is
and you say oh my god
am i here all alone
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says how does it feel
to be such a freak
and you say impossible
as he hands you a bone
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to just give a check
to tax-deductible charity organizations
youve been with the professors
and theyve all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
youve been through all of
f. scott fitzgeralds books
youre very well read
its well known
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
well the sword swallower he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says here is your throat back
thanks for the loan
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
now you see this one-eyed midget
shouting the word now
and you say for what reason
and he says how
and you say what does this mean
and he screams back youre a cow
give me some milk
or else go home
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
well you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there ought to be a law
against you comin around
you should be made
to wear earphones
because something is happening here
but you dont know what it is
do you mister jones
to be alone with you
just you and me
now wont you tell me true
aint that the way it oughta be
to hold each other tight
the whole night through
evrything is always right
when im alone with you
to be alone with you
at the close of the day
with only you in view
while evening slips away
it only goes to show
that while lifes pleasures be few
the only one i know
is when im alone with you
they say that nighttime is the right time
to be with the one you love
too many thoughts get in the way in the day
but youre always what im thinkin of
i wish the night were here
bringin me all of your charms
when only you are near
to hold me in your arms
ill always thank the lord
when my working days through
i get my sweet reward
to be alone with you
one evening for pleasure i rambled to view
the fair fields all alone
down by the banks of loch eiron
where beauty and pleasure were known.
i spied a fair maid at her labour
which caused me to stay for a while
and i thought of a goddess to beauty
bloomin' bright star of bright isle.
i humbled myself to her beauty
fair maiden where do you belong
are you from heaven descended
abiding in cupid's fair throne
young man i will tell you a secret
it's true i'm a maid that is poor
and to part from my vows and my promise
is more than my heart can endure.
therefore i remain at my service
and go through all my hardship and toil
and wait for the lad that has left me
all alone on the banks of belle isle.
young maiden i wish not to banter
it's true i come here in disguise
i came here to fulfill our last promise
and hope to give you a surprise.
i've known you're a maid i love dearly
and you've been in my heart all the while
for me there is no other damsel
than my bloomin' bright star of belle isle.
i love you pretty baby
you're the only love i've ever known
just as long as you stay with me
the whole world is my throne
beyond here lies nothin'
nothin' we can call our own
i'm movin' after midnight
down boulevards of broken cars
don't know what to do without it
without this love that we call ours
beyond here lies nothin'
nothin' but the moon and stars
down every street there's a window
and every window made of glass
we'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
for as long as love will last
beyond here lies nothin'
but the mountains of the past
my ship is in the harbor
and the sails are spread
listen to me pretty baby
lay your hand upon my head
beyond here lies nothin'
nothin' done and nothin' said
beyond the horizon behind the sun
at the end of the rainbow life has only begun
in the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
beyond the horizon it is easy to love
my wretched heart's pounding
i felt an angel's kiss
my memories are drowning
in mortal bliss
beyond the horizon in the springtime or fall
love waits forever for one and for all
beyond the horizon across the divide
'round about midnight we'll be on the same side
down in the valley the water runs cold
beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul
i'm touched with desire
what don't i do
i'll throw the logs on the fire
i'll build my world around you
beyond the horizon at the end of the game
every step that you take i'm walking the same
beyond the horizon the night winds blow
the theme of a melody from many moons ago
the bells of st. mary how sweetly they chime
beyond the horizon i found you just in time
it's dark and it's dreary
i ponder in vain
i'm weakened i'm weary
my repentance is plain
beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
i still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me
beyond the horizon 'neath crimson skies
in the soft light of morning i'll follow you with my eyes
through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
beyond the horizon right down to the bone
it's late in the season
never knew never cared
whatever the reason
someone's life has been spared
beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
i've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

instrumental
i woke in the mornin wandrin
wasted and worn out
i woke in the mornin wandrin
wasted and worn out
wishin my long-lost lover
will walk to me talk to me
tell me what its all about
i was standin at the side road
listenin to the billboard knock
standin at the side road
listenin to the billboard knock
well my wrist was empty
but my nerves were kickin
tickin like a clock
if i got anything you need babe
let me tell you in front
if i got anything you need babe
let me tell you in front
you can come to me sometime
night time day time
any time you want
sometimes im thinkin im
too high to fall
sometimes im thinkin im
too high to fall
other times im thinkin im
so low i dont know
if i can come up at all
black crows in the meadow
across a broad highway
black crows in the meadow
across a broad highway
though its funny honey
i just dont feel much like a
scarecrow today
up on the white veranda
she wears a necktie and a panama hat
her passport shows a face
from another time and place
she looks nothin like that
and all the remnants of her recent past
are scattered in the wild wind
she walks across the marble floor
where a voice from the gambling room is callin her to come on in
she smiles walks the other way
as the last ship sails and the moon fades away
from black diamond bay
as the mornin light breaks open the greek comes down
and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
pardon monsieur the desk clerk says
carefully removes his fez
am i hearin you right
and as the yellow fog is liftin
the greek is quickly headin for the second floor
she passes him on the spiral staircase
thinkin hes the soviet ambassador
she starts to speak but he walks away
as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
on black diamond bay
a soldier sits beneath the fan
doin business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
lightning strikes the lights blow out
the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
can you see anything
then the greek appears on the second floor
in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
says open up another deck
but the dealer says attendez-vous sil vous plait
as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
from black diamond bay
the desk clerk heard the woman laugh
as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
he tried to grab the womans hand
said heres a ring it cost a grand
she said that aint enough
then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
she passed the door that the greek had locked
where a handwritten sign read do not disturb
she knocked upon it anyway
as the sun went down and the music did play
on black diamond bay
ive got to talk to someone quick!
but the greek said go away and he kicked the chair to the floor
he hung there from the chandelier
she cried help theres danger near
please open up the door!
then the volcano erupted
and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
thinking of forbidden love
but the desk clerk said it happens every day
as the stars fell down and the fields burned away
on black diamond bay
as the island slowly sank
the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
the dealer said its too late now
you can take your money but i dont know how
youll spend it in the tomb
the tiny man bit the soldiers ear
as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
while shes out on the balcony where a stranger tells her
my darling je vous aime beaucoup
she sheds a tear and then begins to pray
as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
from black diamond bay
i was sittin home alone one night in l.a.
watchin old cronkite on the seven oclock news
it seems there was an earthquake that
left nothin but a panama hat
and a pair of old greek shoes
didnt seem like much was happenin
so i turned it off and went to grab another beer
seems like every time you turn around
theres another hard-luck story that youre gonna hear
and theres really nothin anyone can say
and i never did plan to go anyway
to black diamond bay

seen the arrow on the doorpost
saying this land is condemned
all the way from new orleans
to jerusalem
i traveled through east texas
where many martyrs fell
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
well i heard that hoot owl singing
as they were taking down the tents
the stars above the barren trees
were his only audience
them charcoal gypsy maidens
can strut their feathers well
but nobody can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
see them big plantations burning
hear the cracking of the whips
smell that sweet magnolia blooming
see the ghosts of slavery ships
i can hear them tribes a-moaning
hear that undertakers bell
nobody can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
theres a woman by the river
with some fine young handsome man
hes dressed up like a squire
bootlegged whiskey in his hand
theres a chain gang on the highway
i can hear them rebels yell
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
well god is in his heaven
and we all want whats his
but power and greed and corruptible seed
seem to be all that there is
im gazing out the window
of the st. james hotel
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell

i was riding on the mayflower
when i thought i spied some land
i yelled for captain arab
i have yuh understand
who came running to the deck
said boys forget the whale
look on over yonder
cut the engines
change the sail
haul on the bowline
we sang that melody
like all tough sailors do
when they are far away at sea
i think ill call it america
i said as we hit land
i took a deep breath
i fell down i could not stand
captain arab he started
writing up some deeds
he said lets set up a fort
and start buying the place with beads
just then this cop comes down the street
crazy as a loon
he throw us all in jail
for carryin harpoons
ah me i busted out
dont even ask me how
i went to get some help
i walked by a guernsey cow
who directed me down
to the bowery slums
where people carried signs around
saying ban the bums
i jumped right into line
sayin i hope that im not late
when i realized i hadnt eaten
for five days straight
i went into a restaurant
lookin for the cook
i told them i was the editor
of a famous etiquette book
the waitress he was handsome
he wore a powder blue cape
i ordered some suzette i said
could you please make that crepe
just then the whole kitchen exploded
from boilin fat
food was flying everywhere
and i left without my hat
now i didnt mean to be nosy
but i went into a bank
to get some bail for arab
and all the boys back in the tank
they asked me for some collateral
and i pulled down my pants
they threw me in the alley
when up comes this girl from france
who invited me to her house
i went but she had a friend
who knocked me out
and robbed my boots
and i was on the street again
well i rapped upon a house
with the u.s. flag upon display
i said could you help me out
i got some friends down the way
the man says get out of here
ill tear you limb from limb
i said you know they refused jesus too
he said youre not him
get out of here before i break your bones
i aint your pop
i decided to have him arrested
and i went looking for a cop
i ran right outside
and i hopped inside a cab
i went out the other door
this englishman said fab
as he saw me leap a hot dog stand
and a chariot that stood
parked across from a building
advertising brotherhood
i ran right through the front door
like a hobo sailor does
but it was just a funeral parlor
and the man asked me who i was
i repeated that my friends
were all in jail with a sigh
he gave me his card
he said call me if they die
i shook his hand and said goodbye
ran out to the street
when a bowling ball came down the road
and knocked me off my feet
a pay phone was ringing
it just about blew my mind
when i picked it up and said hello
this foot came through the line
well by this time i was fed up
at tryin to make a stab
at bringin back any help
for my friends and captain arab
i decided to flip a coin
like either heads or tails
would let me know if i should go
back to ship or back to jail
so i hocked my sailor suit
and i got a coin to flip
it came up tails
it rhymed with sails
so i made it back to the ship
well i got back and took
the parkin ticket off the mast
i was ripping it to shreds
when this coastguard boat went past
they asked me my name
and i said captain kidd
they believed me but
they wanted to know
what exactly that i did
i said for the pope of eruke
i was employed
they let me go right away
they were very paranoid
well the last i heard of arab
he was stuck on a whale
that was married to the deputy
sheriff of the jail
but the funniest thing was
when i was leavin the bay
i saw three ships a-sailin
they were all heading my way
i asked the captain what his name was
and how come he didnt drive a truck
he said his name was columbus
i just said good luck
well the lone ranger and tonto
they are ridin down the line
fixin evrybodys troubles
evrybodys cept mine
somebody musta tol em
that i was doin fine
oh you five and ten cent women
with nothin in your heads
i got a real gal im lovin
and lord ill love her till im dead
go away from my door and my window too
right now
lord i aint goin down to no race track
see no sports car run
i dont have no sports car
and i dont even care to have one
i can walk anytime around the block
well the wind keeps a-blowin me
up and down the street
with my hat in my hand
and my boots on my feet
watch out so you dont step on me
well lookit here buddy
you want to be like me
pull out your six-shooter
and rob every bank you can see
tell the judge i said it was all right
yes!
while riding on a train goin west
i fell asleep for to take my rest
i dreamed a dream that made me sad
concerning myself and the first few friends i had
with half-damp eyes i stared to the room
where my friends and i spent many an afternoon
where we together weathered many a storm
laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn
by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
our words were told our songs were sung
where we longed for nothin and were quite satisfied
talkin and a-jokin about the world outside
with haunted hearts through the heat and cold
we never thought we could ever get old
we thought we could sit forever in fun
but our chances really was a million to one
as easy it was to tell black from white
it was all that easy to tell wrong from right
and our choices were few and the thought never hit
that the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split
how many a year has passed and gone
and many a gamble has been lost and won
and many a road taken by many a friend
and each one ive never seen again
i wish i wish i wish in vain
that we could sit simply in that room again
ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that
oh im sailin away my own true love
im sailin away in the morning
is there something i can send you from across the sea
from the place that ill be landing
no theres nothin you can send me my own true love
theres nothin i wish to be ownin
just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
from across that lonesome ocean
oh but i just thought you might want something fine
made of silver or of golden
either from the mountains of madrid
or from the coast of barcelona
oh but if i had the stars from the darkest night
and the diamonds from the deepest ocean
id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
for thats all im wishin to be ownin
that i might be gone a long time
and its only that im askin
is there something i can send you to remember me by
to make your time more easy passin
oh how can how can you ask me again
it only brings me sorrow
the same thing i want from you today
i would want again tomorrow
i got a letter on a lonesome day
it was from her ship a-sailin
saying i dont know when ill be comin back again
it depends on how im a-feelin
well if you my love must think that-a-way
im sure your mind is roamin
im sure your heart is not with me
but with the country to where youre goin
so take heed take heed of the western wind
take heed of the stormy weather
and yes theres something you can send back to me
spanish boots of spanish leather
in the lonely night
in the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
youre comin thru to me in black and white
when we were made of dreams
youre blowing down the shaky street
youre hearing my heart beat
in the record-breaking heat
where we were born in time
not one more night not one more kiss
not this time baby no more of this
takes too much skill takes too much will
its revealing
you came you saw just like the law
you married young just like your ma
you tried and tried you made me slide
you left me reelin with this feelin
on the rising curve
where the ways of nature will test every nerve
you wont get anything you dont deserve
where we were born in time
you pressed me once you pressed me twice
you hang the flame youll pay the price
oh babe that fire
is still smokin
you were snow you were rain
you were striped you were plain
oh babe truer words
have not been spoken or broken
in the hills of mystery
in the foggy web of destiny
you can have whats left of me
where we were born in time
1.feel like a broke-down engine ain't got no drivin' wheel

well there was this movie i seen one time
about a man riding cross the desert and it starred gregory peck
he was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
the townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck
well the marshal now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
i want him to feel what its like to every moment face his death
well i keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
and you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
you know i cant believe weve lived so long and are still so far apart
the memory of you keeps callin after me like a rollin train
i can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
in your busted down ford and your platform heels
i could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
ah but you were right. it was perfect as i got in behind the wheel
well we drove that car all night into san anton
and we slept near the alamo your skin was so tender and soft
way down in mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
i would have gone on after you but i didnt feel like letting my head get blown off
well were drivin this car and the sun is comin up over the rockies
now i know she aint you but shes here and shes got that dark rhythm in her soul
but im too over the edge and i aint in the mood anymore to remember the times
when i was your only man
and she dont want to remind me. she knows this car would go out of control
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl youre my honey love
well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards amarillo
we pulled up where henry porter used to live. he owned a wreckin lot outside of town about a mile
ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. she saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
she said henry aint here but you can come on in hell be back in a little while
then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin of
bummin a ride back to from where she started
but ya know she changed the subject every time money came up
she said welcome to the land of the living dead
you could tell she was so broken hearted
she said even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt
how far are yall going ruby asked us with a sigh
were going all the way til the wheels fall off and burn
til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies
ruby just smiled and said ah you know some babies never learn
something about that movie though well i just cant get it out of my head
but i cant remember why i was in it or what part i was supposed to play
all i remember about it was gregory peck and the way people moved
and a lot of them seemed to be lookin my way
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl youre my honey love
well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
i was crossin the street when shots rang out
i didnt know whether to duck or to run so i ran
we got him cornered in the churchyard i heard somebody shout
well you saw my picture in the corpus christi tribune. underneath it
it said a man with no alibi
you went out on a limb to testify for me you said i was with you
then when i saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
it was the best acting i saw anybody do
now ive always been the kind of person that doesnt like to trespass
but sometimes you just find yourself over the line
oh if theres an original thought out there i could use it right now
you know i feel pretty good but that aint sayin much. i could feel a whole lot better
if you were just here by my side to show me how
well im standin in line in the rain to see a movie starring gregory peck
yeah but you know its not the one that i had in mind
hes got a new one out now i dont even know what its about
but ill see him in anything so ill stand in line
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl youre my honey love
you know its funny how things never turn out the way you had em planned
the only thing we knew for sure about henry porter is that his name wasnt henry porter
and you know there was somethin about you baby that i liked that was always too good for this world
just like you always said there was somethin about me you liked
that i left behind in the french quarter
strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
i dont have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when im gone
you always said people dont do what they believe in they just do whats most convenient then they repent
and i always said hang on to me baby and lets hope that the roof stays on
there was a movie i seen one time i think i sat through it twice
i dont remember who i was or where i was bound
all i remember about it was it starred gregory peck he wore a gun
and he was shot in the back
seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl youre my honey love
buckets of rain
buckets of tears
got all them buckets comin out of my ears
buckets of moonbeams in my hand
i got all the love honey baby
you can stand
i been meek
and hard like an oak
i seen pretty people disappear like smoke
friends will arrive friends will disappear
if you want me honey baby
ill be here
like your smile
and your fingertips
like the way that you move your lips
i like the cool way you look at me
everything about you is bringing me
misery
little red wagon
little red bike
i aint no monkey but i know what i like
i like the way you love me strong and slow
im takin you with me honey baby
when i go
life is sad
life is a bust
all ya can do is do what you must
you do what you must do and ya do it well
ill do it for you honey baby
cant you tell
i got this graveyard woman you know she keeps my kid
but my soulful mama you know she keeps me hid
shes a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
well if i go down dyin you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well when the pipeline gets broken and im lost on the river bridge
im cracked up on the highway and on the waters edge
she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
well if i go down dyin you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well she dont make me nervous she dont talk too much
she walks like bo diddley and she dont need no crutch
she keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
well if i go down dyin you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well you know i need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead
i need a dump truck mama to unload my head
she brings me everything and more and just like i said
well if i go down dyin you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

bye and bye im breathin a lovers sigh
im sittin on my watch so i can be on time
im singin loves praises with sugar-coated rhyme
bye and bye on you im casting my eye
im paintin the town—swinging my partner around
i know who i can depend on i know who to trust
im watchin the roads im studying the dust
im paintin the town making my last go-round
well im scufflin and im shufflin and im walkin on briars
im not even acquainted with my own desires
im rollin slow—im doing all i know
im tellin myself i found true happiness
that ive still got a dream that hasnt been repossessed
im rollin slow goin where the wild roses grow
well the future for me is already a thing of the past
you were my first love and you will be my last
papa gone mad mamma shes feeling sad
im gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
im gonna establish my rule through civil war
gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be
well i walked all night long
listenin to them church bells tone
yes i walked all night long
listenin to them church bells tone
either someone needing mercy
or maybe something ive done wrong
well your friends come by for you
i dont know what to say
well your friends come by for you
i dont know what to say
i just cant face up to tell em

well i walk on pins and needles
i hope my tongue dont slip
well i gaze at passing strangers
in case i might see you
yes i gaze at passing strangers
in case i might see you
but the sun goes around the heavens
and another day just drives on through
he sits in your room his tomb with a fist full of tacks
preoccupied with his vengeance
cursing the dead that cant answer him back
im sure that he has no intentions
of looking your way unless its to say
that he needs you to test his inventions
can you please crawl out your window
use your arms and legs it wont ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you
you can go back to him any time you want to
he looks so truthful is this how he feels
trying to peel the moon and expose it
with his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
if he needs a third eye he just grows it
he just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
or pick it up after he throws it
can you please crawl out your window
use your arms and legs it wont ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you
you can go back to him any time you want to
why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
are you frightened of the box you keep him in
while his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
their religion of the little tin women
that backs up their views but your face is so bruised
come on out the dark is beginning
can you please crawl out your window
use your arms and legs it wont ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you
you can go back to him any time you want to
1.well it's all of  fair and handsome girl
she's all in her tender years.
she fell in love with a sailor boy
it's true she loved him well.
for to go off to sea with him
like she did not know how
she longed to see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o.
2.so she bargained with the sailor boy
all for a piece of gold.
straightaway then he led her
down into the hold
sayin' i'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
your jacket shall be blue.
you'll see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o.
3.now when the other sailors heard the news
well they fell into a rage
and with all the ship's company
they were willing to engage.
saying we'll tie her hands and feet my boys
overboard we'll throw her.
she'll never see that seaport town
called canadee-i-o.
4.now when the captain he heard the news
well he too fell in a rage
and with the whole ship's company
he was willing to engage
sayin' she'll stay in sailor's clothes
her color shall be blue
she'll see that seaport town
call canadee-i-o.
5.now when they come down to canada
scarcely 'bout half a year
she's married this bold captain
who called her his dear.
she's dressed in silks and satins now
she cuts a gallant show
finest of the ladies
down canadee-i-o.
6.come all you fair and tender girls
wheresoever you may be
i'd have you to follow your own true love
whene'er he goes to sea.
for if the sailors prove false to you
well the captain he might prove true.
you'll see the honor i have gained
by the wearing of the blue.
i cant wait wait for you to change your mind
its late im trying to walk the line
well its way past midnight and there are people all around
some on their way up some on their way down
the air burns and im trying to think straight
and i dont know how much longer i can wait
im your man im trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
you understand that my heart cant go on beating without you
well your loveliness has wounded me im reeling from the blow
i wish i knew what it was keeps me loving you so
im breathing hard standing at the gate
but i dont know how much longer i can wait
skies are grey im looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
night or day it doesnt matter where i go anymore i just go
if i ever saw you coming i dont know what i would do
id like to think i could control myself but it isnt true
thats how it is when things disintegrate
and i dont know how much longer i can wait
im doomed to love you ive been rolling through stormy weather
im thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
its mighty funny the end of time has just begun
oh honey after all these years youre still the one
while im strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
i left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
i thought somehow that i would be spared this fate
but i dont know how much longer i can wait
instrumental
she was the rose of sharon from paradise lost
from the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
i was playing a show in miami in the theater of divine comedy
told about jesus told about the rain
she told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
by a man who danced on the roof of the embassy
was she a child or a woman i cant say which
from one to another she could easily switch
we went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach
could i been used and played as a pawn
it certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech
and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
she looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore
she said we got a mutual friend over by the door
and you know hes got our best interest in mind
he was well connected but her heart was a snare
and she had left him to die in there
there were payments due and he was a little behind
the cry of the peacock flies buzz my head
ceiling fan broken theres a heat in my bed
street band playing nearer my god to thee
we met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
she said i know what youre thinking but there aint a thing
you can do about it so let us just agree to agree
and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
atlantic city by the cold grey sea
i hear a voice crying daddy i always think its for me
but its only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
every new messenger brings evil report
bout armies on the march and time that is short
and famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls
would i have married her i dont know i suppose
she had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
but i kept hearing my name and had to be movin on
i saw screws break loose saw the devil pound tin
i saw a house in the country being torn from within
i heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond
and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
lazy stadium night

so he packed his glove and took his arm
an one day he just ran away

nobody can throw the ball like catfish can
come up where the yankees are

the cats in the well the wolf is looking down
the cats in the well the wolf is looking down
he got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
the cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
she aint hearing a thing the silence is a-stickin her deep
the cats in the well and grief is showing its face
the worlds being slaughtered and its such a bloody disgrace
the cats in the well the horse is going bumpety bump
the cats in the well and the horse is going bumpety bump
back alley sally is doing the american jump
the cats in the well and papa is reading the news
his hairs falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
the cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
the cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
the night is so long and the table is oh so full
the cats in the well and the servant is at the door
the drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
the cats in the well the leaves are starting to fall
the cats in the well leaves are starting to fall
goodnight my love may the lord have mercy on us all
sixteen years
sixteen banners united over the field
where the good shepherd grieves
desperate men desperate women divided
spreading their wings neath the falling leaves
fortune calls
i stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down
shes smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
on midsummers eve near the tower
the cold-blooded moon
the captain waits above the celebration
sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
whose ebony face is beyond communication
the captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
they shaved her head
she was torn between jupiter and apollo
a messenger arrived with a black nightingale
i seen her on the stairs and i couldnt help but follow
follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
i stumbled to my feet
i rode past destruction in the ditches
with the stitches still mending neath a heart-shaped tattoo
renegade priests and treacherous young witches
were handing out the flowers that id given to you
the palace of mirrors
where dog soldiers are reflected
the endless road and the wailing of chimes
the empty rooms where her memory is protected
where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times
she wakes him up
forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks
shes begging to know what measures he now will be taking
hes pulling her down and shes clutching on to his long golden locks
gentlemen he said
i dont need your organization ive shined your shoes
ive moved your mountains and marked your cards
but eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination
or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
peace will come
with tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
but will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
between the king and the queen of swords
far between sundowns finish an midnights broken toll
we ducked inside the doorway thunder crashing
as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
an for each an evry underdog soldier in the night
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
in the citys melted furnace unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden while the walls were tightening
as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain
dissolved into the bells of the lightning
tolling for the rebel tolling for the rake
tolling for the luckless the abandoned an forsaked
tolling for the outcast burnin constantly at stake
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
striking for the gentle striking for the kind
striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
an the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
for the disrobed faceless forms of no position
tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
all down in taken-for-granted situations
tolling for the deaf an blind tolling for the mute
tolling for the mistreated mateless mother the mistitled prostitute
for the misdemeanor outlaw chased an cheated by pursuit
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
even though a clouds white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
an the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones
condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail
for the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
an for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
starry-eyed an laughing as i recall when we were caught
trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
as we listened one last time an we watched with one last look
spellbound an swallowed til the tolling ended
tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
for the countless confused accused misused strung-out ones an worse
an for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
everybody wants to know why he couldnt adjust
adjust to what a dream that bust
he was a clean-cut kid
but they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
they said whats up is down they said what isnt is
they put ideas in his head he thought were his
he was a clean-cut kid
but they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
he was on the baseball team he was in the marching band
when he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
he was a clean-cut kid
but they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
he went to church on sunday he was a boy scout
for his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
he was a clean-cut kid
but they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
they said listen boy youre just a pup
they sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
they gave him dope to smoke drinks and pills
a jeep to drive blood to spill
they said congratulations you got what it takes
they sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
he was a clean-cut kid
but they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
he bought the american dream but it put him in debt
the only game he could play was russian roulette
he drank coca-cola he was eating wonder bread
ate burger kings he was well fed
he went to hollywood to see peter otoole
he stole a rolls-royce and drove it in a swimming pool
they took a clean-cut kid
and they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
he couldve sold insurance owned a restaurant or bar
couldve been an accountant or a tennis star
he was wearing boxing gloves took a dive one day
off the golden gate bridge into china bay
his mama walks the floor his daddy weeps and moans
they gotta sleep together in a home they dont own
they took a clean-cut kid
and they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
well everybodys asking why he couldnt adjust
all he ever wanted was somebody to trust
they took his head and turned it inside out
he never did know what it was all about
he had a steady job he joined the choir
he never did plan to walk the high wire
they took a clean-cut kid
and they made a killer out of him
thats what they did
after a while we took in the clothes
nobody said very much
just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
which nobody really wanted to touch
mama come in and picked up a book
an papa asked her what it was
someone else asked what do you care
papa said well just because
then they started to take back their clothes
hang em on the line
it was january the thirtieth
and everybody was feelin fine

i reached up touched my shirt
and the neighbor said are those clothes yours
i said some of em not all of em

i went back in the house and mama met me
and then i shut all the doors
im beginning to hear voices and theres no one around

i went to church on sunday and she passed by
my love for her is taking such a long time to die
im waist deep waist deep in the mist
its almost like almost like i dont exist
im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
the walls of pride are high and wide
cant see over to the other side
its such a sad thing to see beauty decay
its sadder still to feel your heart torn away
one look at you and im out of control
like the universe has swallowed me whole
im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
theres too many people too many to recall
i thought some of m were friends of mine i was wrong about m all
well the road is rocky and the hillsides mud
up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
i found my world found my world in you
but your love just hasnt proved true
im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
oh the winds in chicago have torn me to shreds
reality has always had too many heads
some things last longer than you think they will
there are some kind of things you can never kill
its you and you only i been thinking about
but you cant see in and its hard lookin out
im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
well the fats in the fire and the waters in the tank
the whiskeys in the jar and the moneys in the bank
i tried to love and protect you because i cared
im gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
looking at you and im on my bended knee
you have no idea what you do to me
im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

im gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey—ill die before i turn senile
well i cried for you—now its your turn you can cry awhile
well you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
i always said youd be sorry and today could be the day
i might need a good lawyer could be your funeral my trial
well i cried for you now its your turn you can cry awhile
oh the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
theyre drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
i live in another world where life and death are memorized
where the earth is strung with lovers pearls and all i see are dark eyes
a cock is crowing far away and another soldiers deep in prayer
some mothers child has gone astray she cant find him anywhere
but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
whom natures beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes
they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand im sure it is.
but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes.
oh the french girl shes in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
oh time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes
oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
the birdies were flying from tree to tree
there was little to say there was no conversation
as i stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
and the locusts sang off in the distance
yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
oh the locusts sang off in the distance
yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me
i glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
darkness was everywhere it smelled like a tomb
i was ready to leave i was already walkin
but the next time i looked there was light in the room
and the locusts sang yeah it give me a chill
oh the locusts sang such a sweet melody
oh the locusts sang their high whining trill
yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me
outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin
the weather was hot a-nearly 90 degrees
the man standin next to me his head was exploding
well i was prayin the pieces wouldnt fall on me
yeah the locusts sang off in the distance
yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
oh the locusts sang off in the distance
and the locusts sang and they were singing for me
i put down my robe picked up my diploma
took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
straight for the hills the black hills of dakota
sure was glad to get out of there alive
and the locusts sang well it give me a chill
yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
and the locusts sang with a high whinin trill
yeah the locusts sang and they was singing for me
singing for me well singing for me
uttering idle words from a reprobate mind
clinging to strange promises dying on the vine
never bein able to separate the good from the bad
ooh i cant stand it i cant stand it
its makin me feel so sad
dead man dead man
when will you arise
cobwebs in your mind
dust upon your eyes
satan got you by the heel theres a birds nest in your hair
do you have any faith at all do you have any love to share
the way that you hold your head cursin god with every move
ooh i cant stand it i cant stand it
what are you tryin to prove
dead man dead man
when will you arise
cobwebs in your mind
dust upon your eyes
the glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin
the ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in
the race of the engine that overrules your heart
ooh i cant stand it i cant stand it
pretending that youre so smart
dead man dead man
when will you arise
cobwebs in your mind
dust upon your eyes
what are you tryin to overpower me with the doctrine or the gun
my back is already to the wall where can i run
the tuxedo that youre wearin the flower in your lapel
ooh i cant stand it i cant stand it
you wanna take me down to hell
dead man dead man
when will you arise
cobwebs in your mind
dust upon your eyes
dear landlord
please dont put a price on my soul
my burden is heavy
my dreams are beyond control
when that steamboat whistle blows
im gonna give you all i got to give
and i do hope you receive it well
dependin on the way you feel that you live
dear landlord
please heed these words that i speak
i know youve suffered much
but in this you are not so unique
all of us at times we might work too hard
to have it too fast and too much
and anyone can fill his life up
with things he can see but he just cannot touch
dear landlord
please dont dismiss my case
im not about to argue
im not about to move to no other place
now each of us has his own special gift
and you know this was meant to be true
and if you dont underestimate me
i wont underestimate you
twas down in mississippi not so long ago
when a young boy from chicago town stepped through a southern door
this boys dreadful tragedy i can still remember well
the color of his skin was black and his name was emmett till
some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
they said they had a reason but i cant remember what
they tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
there were screaming sounds inside the barn there was laughing sounds
     out on the street
then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
and they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
the reason that they killed him there and im sure it aint no lie
was just for the fun of killin him and to watch him slowly die
and then to stop the united states of yelling for a trial
two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor emmett till
but on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this
     awful crime
and so this trial was a mockery but nobody seemed to mind
i saw the morning papers but i could not bear to see
the smiling brothers walkin down the courthouse stairs
for the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
while emmetts body floats the foam of a jim crow southern sea
if you cant speak out against this kind of thing a crime thats so unjust
your eyes are filled with dead mens dirt your mind is filled with dust
your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains and your blood
     it must refuse to flow
for you let this human race fall down so god-awful low!
this song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man
that this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed ku klux klan
but if all of us folks that thinks alike if we gave all we could give
we could make this great land of ours a greater place to live
when youre sad and when youre lonely
and you havent got a friend
just remember that death is not the end
and all that youve held sacred
falls down and does not mend
just remember that death is not the end
not the end not the end
just remember that death is not the end
when youre standing at the crossroads
that you cannot comprehend
just remember that death is not the end
and all your dreams have vanished
and you dont know whats up the bend
just remember that death is not the end
not the end not the end
just remember that death is not the end
when the storm clouds gather round you
and heavy rains descend
just remember that death is not the end
and theres no one there to comfort you
with a helpin hand to lend
just remember that death is not the end
not the end not the end
just remember that death is not the end
oh the tree of life is growing
where the spirit never dies
and the bright light of salvation shines
in dark and empty skies
when the cities are on fire
with the burning flesh of men
just remember that death is not the end
and you search in vain to find
just one law-abiding citizen
just remember that death is not the end
not the end not the end
just remember that death is not the end

looking for them rounders looking out for me.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
men in atlanta tryin' to pass for white

theyre selling postcards of the hanging
theyre painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
theyve got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other is in his pants
and the riot squad theyre restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row
cinderella she seems so easy
it takes one to know one she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo hes moaning
you belong to me i believe
and someone says youre in the wrong place my friend
you better leave
and the only sound thats left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row
now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortune-telling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain
and the good samaritan hes dressing
hes getting ready for the show
hes going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row
now ophelia shes neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty-second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her professions her religion
her sin is her lifelessness
and though her eyes are fixed upon
noahs great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row
einstein disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend a jealous monk
he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet
now you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row
dr. filth he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
theyre trying to blow it up
now his nurse some local loser
shes in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
have mercy on his soul
they all play on pennywhistles
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row
across the street theyve nailed the curtains
theyre getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
a perfect image of a priest
theyre spoonfeeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then theyll kill him with self-confidence
after poisoning him with words
and the phantoms shouting to skinny girls
get outa here if you dont know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row
now at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row
praise be to neros neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
and everybodys shouting
which side are you on
and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captains tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers
between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row
yes i received your letter yesterday
(about the time the doorknob broke)
when you asked how i was doing
was that some kind of joke
all these people that you mention
yes i know them theyre quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name
right now i cant read too good
dont send me no more letters no
not unless you mail them
from desolation row
1.now there's a man you'll hear about
most anywhere you go
and his holdings are in texas
and his name is diamond joe.
2.and he carries all his money
in a diamond-studded jar.
he never took much trouble
with the process of the law.
3.i hired out to diamond joe boys
did offer him my hand
he gave a string of horses
so old they could not stand.
4.and i nearly starved to death boys
he did mistreat me so
and i never saved a dollar
in the pay of diamond joe.
5.now his bread it was corn dodger
and his meat you couldn't chaw
nearly drove me crazy
with the waggin' of his jaw.
6.and the tellin' of his story
mean to let you know
that there never was a rounder
that could lie like diamond joe.
instrumental
7.now i tried three times to quit him
but he did argue so
i'm still punchin' cattle
in the pay of diamond joe.
8.and when i'm called up yonder
and it's my time to go
give my blankets to my buddies
give the fleas to diamond joe.
fat man lookin in a blade of steel
thin man lookin at his last meal
hollow man lookin in a cottonfield
for dignity
wise man lookin in a blade of grass
young man lookin in the shadows that pass
poor man lookin through painted glass
for dignity
somebody got murdered on new years eve
somebody said dignity was the first to leave
i went into the city went into the town
went into the land of the midnight sun
searchin high searchin low
searchin everywhere i know
askin the cops wherever i go
have you seen dignity
blind man breakin out of a trance
puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
hopin to find one circumstance
of dignity
i went to the wedding of mary lou
she said i dont want nobody see me talkin to you
said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
about dignity
i went down where the vultures feed
i wouldve gone deeper but there wasnt any need
heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
wasnt any difference to me
chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
house on fire debts unpaid
gonna stand at the window gonna ask the maid
have you seen dignity
drinkin man listens to the voice he hears
in a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
lookin into the lost forgotten years
for dignity
met prince phillip at the home of the blues
said hed give me information if his name wasnt used
he wanted money up front said he was abused
by dignity
footprints runnin cross the silver sand
steps goin down into tattoo land
i met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
in the bordertowns of despair
got no place to fade got no coat
im on the rollin river in a jerkin boat
tryin to read a note somebody wrote
about dignity
sick man lookin for the doctors cure
lookin at his hands for the lines that were
and into every masterpiece of literature
for dignity
englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
combin his hair back his future looks thin
bites the bullet and he looks within
for dignity
someone showed me a picture and i just laughed
dignity never been photographed
i went into the red went into the black
into the valley of dry bone dreams
so many roads so much at stake
so many dead ends im at the edge of the lake
sometimes i wonder what its gonna take
to find dignity
i hate myself for lovin you and the weakness that it showed
you were just a painted face on a trip down suicide road
the stage was set the lights went out all around the old hotel
i hate myself for lovin you and im glad the curtain fell
i hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
and the mercy that you showed to me who ever would have guessed
i went out on lower broadway and i felt that place within
that hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin
heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
like a slave in orbit hes beaten til hes tame
all for a moments glory and its a dirty rotten shame
there are those who worship loneliness im not one of them
in this age of fiberglass im searching for a gem
the crystal ball up on the wall hasnt shown me nothing yet
ive paid the price of solitude but at least im out of debt
cant recall a useful thing you ever did for me
cept pat me on the back one time when i was on my knees
we stared into each others eyes til one of us would break
no use to apologize what diffrence would it make
so sing your praise of progress and of the doom machine
the naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
lady luck who shines on me will tell you where im at
i hate myself for lovin you but i should get over that
gon walk down that dirt road til someone lets me ride
gon walk down that dirt road til someone lets me ride
if i cant find my baby im gonna run away and hide
i been pacing around the room hoping maybe shed come back
pacing round the room hoping maybe shed come back
well i been praying for salvation laying round in a one-room country shack
gon walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
gon walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
til theres nothing left to see til the chains have been shattered
and ive been freed
i been lookin at my shadow i been watching the colors up above
lookin at my shadow watching the colors up above
rolling through the rain and hail looking for the sunny side of love
gon walk on down that dirt road til im right beside the sun
gon walk on down until im right beside the sun
im gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone

how long can i stay in this nowhere caf&eacute;
'fore night turns into day
i wonder why i'm so frightened of dawn
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
there's a moment when all old things
become new again
but that moment might have come and gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
i look away but i keep seeing it
i don't want to believe but i keep believing it
shadows dance upon the wall
shadows that seem to know it all
am i too blind to see is my heart playing tricks on me
i'm lost in the crowd
all my tears are gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
everything i touch seems to disappear
everywhere i turn you are always here
i'll run this race until my earthly death
i'll defend this place with my dying breath
from a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
i saw a star from heaven fall
i turned and looked again but it was gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
oh help me in my weakness
i heard the drifter say
as they carried him from the courtroom
and were taking him away
my trip hasnt been a pleasant one
and my time it isnt long
and i still do not know
what it was that ive done wrong
well the judge he cast his robe aside
a tear came to his eye
you fail to understand he said
why must you even try
outside the crowd was stirring
you could hear it from the door
inside the judge was stepping down
while the jury cried for more
oh stop that cursed jury
cried the attendant and the nurse
the trial was bad enough
but this is ten times worse
just then a bolt of lightning
struck the courthouse out of shape
and while evrybody knelt to pray
the drifter did escape
i didnt know that youd be leavin
or who you thought you were talkin to
i figure maybe were even
or maybe im one up on you
i send you all my money
just like i did before
i tried to reach you honey
but youre driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
i aint gonna get lost in this current
i dont like playing cat and mouse
no gentleman likes making love to a servant
especially when hes in his fathers house
i never could guess your weight baby
never needed to call you my whore
i always thought you were straight baby
but youre driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
well these times and these tunnels are haunted
the bottom of the barrel is too
i waited years sometimes for what i wanted
everybody cant be as lucky as you
never no more do i wonder
why you dont never play with me anymore
at any moment you could go under
cause youre driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
driftin too far from shore
you and me we had completeness
i give you all of what i could provide
we werent on the wrong side sweetness
we were the wrong side
ive already ripped out the phones honey
you cant walk the streets in a war
i can finish this alone honey
youre driftin too far from shore
come baby find me come baby remind me of where i once begun
come baby show me show me you know me tell me youre the one
i could be learning you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
but i will always be emotionally yours
come baby rock me come baby lock me into the shadows of your heart
come baby teach me come baby reach me let the music start
i could be dreaming but i keep believing youre the one im livin for
and i will always be emotionally yours
its like my whole life never happened
when i see you its as if i never had a thought
i know this dream it might be crazy
but its the only one ive got
come baby shake me come baby take me i would be satisfied
come baby hold me come baby help me my arms are open wide
i could be unraveling wherever im traveling even to foreign shores
but i will always be emotionally yours
i sang the song slowly
as she stood in the shadows
she stepped to the light
as my silver strings spun
she called with her eyes
to the tune is a-playin
but the song it was long
and id only begun
through a bullet of light
her face was reflectin
the fast fading words
that rolled from my tongue
with a long-distance look
her eyes was on fire
but the song it was long
and there was more to be sung
my eyes danced a circle
across her clear outline
with her head tilted sideways
she called me again
as the tune drifted out
she breathed hard through the echo
but the song it was long
and it was far to the end
i glanced at my guitar
and played it pretendin
that of all the eyes out there
i could see none
as her thoughts pounded hard
like the pierce of an arrow
but the song it was long
and it had to get done
as the tune finally folded
i laid down the guitar
then looked for the girl
whod stayed for so long
but her shadow was missin
for all of my searchin
so i picked up my guitar
and began the next song
in the time of my confession in the hour of my deepest need
when the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere
toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
like cain i now behold this chain of events that i must break
in the fury of the moment i can see the masters hand
in every leaf that trembles in every grain of sand
oh the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
to ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
i gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
and every time i pass that way i always hear my name
then onward in my journey i come to understand
that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
i have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
in the violence of a summers dream in the chill of a wintry light
in the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
i hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
sometimes i turn theres someone there other times its only me
i am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
like every sparrow falling like every grain of sand
broken lines broken strings
broken threads broken springs
broken idols broken heads
people sleeping in broken beds
aint no use jiving
aint no use joking
everything is broken
broken bottles broken plates
broken switches broken gates
broken dishes broken parts
streets are filled with broken hearts
broken words never meant to be spoken
everything is broken
seem like every time you stop and turn around
something else just hit the ground
broken cutters broken saws
broken buckles broken laws
broken bodies broken bones
broken voices on broken phones
take a deep breath feel like youre chokin'
everything is broken
every time you leave and go off someplace
things fall to pieces in my face
broken hands on broken ploughs
broken treaties broken vows
broken pipes broken tools
people bending broken rules
hound dog howling bullfrog croaking
everything is broken
farewell angelina
the bells of the crown
are being stolen by bandits
i must follow the sound
the triangle tingles
and the trumpets play slow
farewell angelina
the sky is on fire
and i must go
theres no need for anger
theres no need for blame
theres nothing to prove
evrythings still the same
just a table standing empty
by the edge of the sea
farewell angelina
the sky is trembling
and i must leave
the jacks and the queens
have forsaked the courtyard
fifty-two gypsies
now file past the guards
in the space where the deuce
and the ace once ran wild
farewell angelina
the sky is folding
ill see you in a while
see the cross-eyed pirates sitting
perched in the sun
shooting tin cans
with a sawed-off shotgun
and the neighbors they clap
and they cheer with each blast
farewell angelina
the skys changing color
and i must leave fast
king kong little elves
on the rooftops they dance
valentino-type tangos
while the makeup mans hands
shut the eyes of the dead
not to embarrass anyone
farewell angelina
the sky is embarrassed
and i must be gone
the machine guns are roaring
the puppets heave rocks
the fiends nail time bombs
to the hands of the clocks
call me any name you like
i will never deny it
farewell angelina
the sky is erupting
i must go where its quiet
oh its fare thee well my darlin true
im leavin in the first hour of the morn
im bound off for the bay of mexico
or maybe the coast of californ
so its fare thee well my own true love
well meet another day another time
it aint the leavin
thats a-grievin me
but my true love whos bound to stay behind
oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
and the rain shes a-turnin into hail
i still might strike it lucky on a highway goin west
though im travelin on a path beaten trail
so its fare thee well my own true love
well meet another day another time
it aint the leavin
thats a-grievin me
but my true love whos bound to stay behind

so its fare thee well my own true love
well meet another day another time
it aint the leavin
thats a-grievin me
but my true love whos bound to stay behind
i will tell you of the laughter and of troubles

with my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
i will travel unnoticed and unknown
so its fare thee well my own true love
well meet another day another time
it aint the leavin
thats a-grievin me
but my true love whos bound to stay behind
ive heard tell of a town where i might as well be bound
its down around the old mexican plains
they say that the people are all friendly there
and all they ask of you is your name
so its fare thee well my own true love
well meet another day another time
it aint the leavin
thats a-grievin me
but my true love whos bound to stay behind
father of night father of day
father who taketh the darkness away
father who teacheth the bird to fly
builder of rainbows up in the sky
father of loneliness and pain
father of love and father of rain
father of day father of night
father of black father of white
father who build the mountain so high
who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
father of time father of dreams
father who turneth the rivers and streams
father of grain father of wheat
father of cold and father of heat
father of air and father of trees
who dwells in our hearts and our memories
father of minutes father of days
father of whom we most solemnly praise
instrumental
down over the window
comes the dazzling sunlit rays
through the back alleys—through the blinds
another one of them endless days
honey bees are buzzin
leaves begin to stir
im in love with my second cousin
i tell myself i could be happy forever with her
i keep listenin for footsteps
but i aint hearing any
from the boat i fish for bullheads
i catch a lot sometimes too many
a summer breeze is blowing
a squall is settin in
sometimes its just plain stupid
to get into any kind of wind
the old men round here sometimes they get
on bad terms with the younger men
but old young age dont carry weight
it doesnt matter in the end
one of the boss hangers-on
comes to call at times you least expect
try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
it has the opposite effect
theres a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
the old one is long gone
timber two-foot-six across
burns with the bark still on
they say times are hard if you dont believe it
you can just follow your nose
it dont bother me—times are hard everywhere
well just have to see how it goes
my old man hes like some feudal lord
got more lives than a cat
never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
things come alive or they fall flat
you can smell the pinewood burnin
you can hear the school bell ring
gotta get up near the teacher if you can
if you wanna learn anything
romeo he said to juliet you got a poor complexion
it doesnt give your appearance a very youthful touch!
juliet said back to romeo why dont you just shove off
if it bothers you so much
they all got out of here any way they could
the cold rain can give you the shivers
they went down the ohio the cumberland the tennessee
all the rest of them rebel rivers
if you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
you do so at the peril of your own life
im not quite as cool or forgiving as i sound
ive seen enough heartaches and strife
my grandfather was a duck trapper
he could do it with just dragnets and ropes
my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
i dont know if they had any dreams or hopes
i had em once though i suppose to go along
with all the ring-dancin christmas carols on all of the christmas eves
i left all my dreams and hopes
buried under tobacco leaves
its not always easy kicking someone out
gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
and tears or not its too much to ask
like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
so can a woman who passes herself off as a male
they sang danny boy at his funeral and the lords prayer
preacher talking bout christ betrayed
its like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
he reached too high was thrown back to the ground
you know what they say about bein nice to the right people on the way up
sooner or later you gonna meet them comin down
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
hear ya got a brother named james dont forget faces or names
sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
he looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
but he drinks and drinks can be fixed
sing me one more song about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
and your fall-by-the sword love affair with errol flynn
in these times of compassion when conformitys in fashion
say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
theres a retired businessman named red
cast down from heaven and hes out of his head
he feeds off of everyone that he can touch
he said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
hes not somebody that you play around with much
miss delilah is his a phillistine is what she is
shell do wondrous works with your fate feed you coconut bread
spice buns in your bed
if you dont mind sleepin with your head face down in a grave
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
well theyll choose a man for you to meet tonight
youll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
how to enter into the gates of paradise
no how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
yeah from the stage theyll be tryin to get water outa rocks
a whore will pass the hat collect a hundred grand and say thanks
they like to take all this money from sin build big universities to study in
sing amazing grace all the way to the swiss banks
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
they got some beautiful people out there man
they can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
they got mystery written all over their forehead
they kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
they dont believe in mercy
judgement on them is something that youll never see
they can exalt you up or bring you down main route
turn you into anything that they want you to be
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
yes i guess i loved him too
i can still see him in my mind climbin that hill
did he make it to the top well he probably did and dropped
struck down by the strength of the will
aint nothin left here partner just the dust of a plague
that has left this whole town afraid
from now on thisll be where youre from
let the dead bury the dead. your time will come
let hot iron blow as he raised the shade
well there aint no goin back
when your foot of pride come down
aint no goin back
may god bless and keep you always
may your wishes all come true
may you always do for others
and let others do for you
may you build a ladder to the stars
and climb on every rung
may you stay forever young
forever young forever young
may you stay forever young
may you grow up to be righteous
may you grow up to be true
may you always know the truth
and see the lights surrounding you
may you always be courageous
stand upright and be strong
may you stay forever young
forever young forever young
may you stay forever young
may your hands always be busy
may your feet always be swift
may you have a strong foundation
when the winds of changes shift
may your heart always be joyful
may your song always be sung
may you stay forever young
forever young forever young
may you stay forever young
forgetful heart
lost your power of recall
every little detail
you don't remember at all
the times we knew
who would remember better then you
forgetful heart
we laughed and had a good time you and i
it's been so long
now you're content to let the days go by
when you were there
you were the answer to my prayer
forgetful heart
we loved with all the love that life can give
what can i say
without you it's so hard to live
can't take much more
why can't we love like we did before
forgetful heart
like a walking shadow in my brain
all night long
i lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
the door has closed forevermore
if indeed there ever was a door
when she said
dont waste your words theyre just lies
i cried she was deaf
and she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
then said what else you got left
it was then that i got up to leave
but she said dont forget
everybody must give something back
for something they get
i stood there and hummed
i tapped on her drum and asked her how come
and she buttoned her boot
and straightened her suit
then she said dont get cute
so i forced my hands in my pockets
and felt with my thumbs
and gallantly handed her
my very last piece of gum
she threw me outside
i stood in the dirt where evryone walked
and after finding id
forgotten my shirt
i went back and knocked
i waited in the hallway she went to get it
and i tried to make sense
out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
that leaned up against . . .
her jamaican rum
and when she did come i asked her for some
she said no dear
i said your words arent clear
youd better spit out your gum
she screamed till her face got so red
then she fell on the floor
and i covered her up and then
thought id go look through her drawer
and when i was through
i filled up my shoe
and brought it to you
and you you took me in
you loved me then
you didnt waste time
and i i never took much
i never asked for your crutch
now dont ask for mine
i was born in dixie in a boomer shed
just a little shanty by the railroad track
freight train was it taught me how to cry
the holler of the driver was my lullaby
i got the freight train blues
oh lord mama i got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
and when the whistle blows i gotta go baby don't you know
well it looks like i'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
well my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
she was the only daugther of an enginer
my sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
seems a waste to get a good man broke
i got the freight train blues
oh lord mama i got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
and when the whistle blows i gotta go mama don't you know
well it looks like i'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
well the only thing that makes me laugh again
is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
every place i wanna go i never can go
because you know i got the freight train blues
oh lord mama i got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.
when they came for him in the garden did they know
when they came for him in the garden did they know
did they know he was the son of god did they know that he was lord
did they hear when he told peter peter put up your sword
when they came for him in the garden did they know
when they came for him in the garden did they know
when he spoke to them in the city did they hear
when he spoke to them in the city did they hear
nicodemus came at night so he wouldnt be seen by men
saying master tell me why a man must be born again
when he spoke to them in the city did they hear
when he spoke to them in the city did they hear
when he healed the blind and crippled did they see
when he healed the blind and crippled did they see
when he said pick up your bed and walk why must you criticize
same thing my father do i can do likewise
when he healed the blind and crippled did they see
when he healed the blind and crippled did they see
did they speak out against him did they dare
did they speak out against him did they dare
the multitude wanted to make him king put a crown upon his head
why did he slip away to a quiet place instead
did they speak out against him did they dare
did they speak out against him did they dare
when he rose from the dead did they believe
when he rose from the dead did they believe
he said all power is given to me in heaven and on earth
did they know right then and there what the power was worth
when he rose from the dead did they believe
when he rose from the dead did they believe
of war and peace the truth just twists
its curfew gull just glides
upon four-legged forest clouds
the cowboy angel rides
with his candle lit into the sun
though its glow is waxed in black
all except when neath the trees of eden
the lamppost stands with folded arms
its iron claws attached
to curbs neath holes where babies wail
though it shadows metal badge
all and all can only fall
with a crashing but meaningless blow
no sound ever comes from the gates of eden
the savage soldier sticks his head in sand
and then complains
unto the shoeless hunter whos gone deaf
but still remains
upon the beach where hound dogs bay
at ships with tattooed sails
heading for the gates of eden
with a time-rusted compass blade
aladdin and his lamp
sits with utopian hermit monks
sidesaddle on the golden calf
and on their promises of paradise
you will not hear a laugh
all except inside the gates of eden
relationships of ownership
they whisper in the wings
to those condemned to act accordingly
and wait for succeeding kings
and i try to harmonize with songs
the lonesome sparrow sings
there are no kings inside the gates of eden
the motorcycle black madonna
two-wheeled gypsy queen
and her silver-studded phantom cause
the gray flannel dwarf to scream
as he weeps to wicked birds of prey
who pick up on his bread crumb sins
and there are no sins inside the gates of eden
the kingdoms of experience
in the precious wind they rot
while paupers change possessions
each one wishing for what the other has got
and the princess and the prince
discuss whats real and what is not
it doesnt matter inside the gates of eden
the foreign sun it squints upon
a bed that is never mine
as friends and other strangers
from their fates try to resign
leaving men wholly totally free
to do anything they wish to do but die
and there are no trials inside the gates of eden
at dawn my lover comes to me
and tells me of her dreams
with no attempts to shovel the glimpse
into the ditch of what each one means
at times i think there are no words
but these to tell whats true
and there are no truths outside the gates of eden
i woke up this mornin
there were tears in my bed
they killed a man i really loved
shot him through the head
lord lord
they cut george jackson down
lord lord
they laid him in the ground
sent him off to prison
for a seventy-dollar robbery
closed the door behind him
and they threw away the key
lord lord
they cut george jackson down
lord lord
they laid him in the ground
he wouldnt take shit from no one
he wouldnt bow down or kneel
authorities they hated him
because he was just too real
lord lord
they cut george jackson down
lord lord
they laid him in the ground
prison guards they cursed him
as they watched him from above
but they were frightened of his power
they were scared of his love.
lord lord
so they cut george jackson down.
lord lord
they laid him in the ground.
sometimes i think this whole world
is one big prison yard
some of us are prisoners
the rest of us are guards
lord lord
they cut george jackson down
lord lord
they laid him in the ground
well if youre travelin in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
she once was a true love of mine
well if you go when the snowflakes storm
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see if shes wearing a coat so warm
to keep her from the howlin winds
please see for me if her hair hangs long
if it rolls and flows all down her breast.
please see for me if her hair hangs long
thats the way i remember her best.
im a-wonderin if she remembers me at all
many times ive often prayed
in the darkness of my night
in the brightness of my day
so if youre travelin in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
she once was a true love of mine
god knows you aint pretty
god knows its true
god knows there aint anybody
ever gonna take the place of you
god knows its a struggle
god knows its a crime
god knows theres gonna be no more water
but fire next time
god dont call it treason
god dont call it wrong
it was supposed to last a season
but its been so strong for so long
god knows its fragile
god knows everything
god knows it could snap apart right now
just like putting scissors to a string
god knows its terrifying
god sees it all unfold
theres a million reasons for you to be crying
you been so bold and so cold
god knows that when you see it
god knows youve got to weep
god knows the secrets of your heart
hell tell them to you when youre asleep
god knows theres a river
god knows how to make it flow
god knows you aint gonna be taking
nothing with you when you go
god knows theres a purpose
god knows theres a chance
god knows you can rise above the darkest hour
of any circumstance
god knows theres a heaven
god knows its out of sight
god knows we can get all the way from here to there
even if weve got to walk a million miles by candlelight
oh my name it is nothin
my age it means less
the country i come from
is called the midwest
is taught and brought up there
the laws to abide
and that the land that i live in
has god on its side
oh the history books tell it
they tell it so well
the cavalries charged
the indians fell
the cavalries charged
the indians died
oh the country was young
with god on its side
oh the spanish-american
war had its day
and the civil war too
was soon laid away
and the names of the heroes
ls made to memorize
with guns in their hands
and god on their side
oh the first world war boys
it closed out its fate
the reason for fighting
i never got straight
but i learned to accept it
accept it with pride
for you dont count the dead
when gods on your side
when the second world war
came to an end
we forgave the germans
and we were friends
though they murdered six million
in the ovens they fried
the germans now too
have god on their side
ive learned to hate russians
all through my whole life
if another war starts
its them we must fight
to hate them and fear them
to run and to hide
and accept it all bravely
with god on my side
but now we got weapons
of the chemical dust
if fire them were forced to
then fire them we must
one push of the button
and a shot the world wide
and you never ask questions
when gods on your side
through many dark hour
ive been thinkin about this
that jesus christ
was betrayed by a kiss
but i cant think for you
youll have to decide
whether judas iscariot
had god on his side
so now as im leavin
im weary as hell
the confusion im feelin
aint no tongue can tell
the words fill my head
and fall to the floor
if gods on our side
hell stop the next war

smoky autumn night stars up in the sky
i see the sailin boats across the bay go by
eucalyptus trees hang above the street
and then i turn my head for youre approachin me
moonlight on the water fishermans daughter floatin in to my room
with a golden loom
first we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
and then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
i see the hungry clouds up above your face
and then the tears roll down what a bitter taste
and then you drift away on a summers day where the wildflowers bloom
with your golden loom
i walk across the bridge in the dismal light
where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
i see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
and then i kiss your lips as i lift your veil
but youre gone and then all i seem to recall is the smell of perfume
and your golden loom
gonna change my way of thinking

sons becoming husbands to their mothers
and old men turning young daughters into whores
stripes on your shoulders
stripes on your back and on your hands
stripes on your shoulders
stripes on your back and on your hands
swords piercing your side
blood and water flowing through the land
well dont know which one is worse
doing your own thing or just being cool
well dont know which one is worse

you forget all about the golden rule

you can take ahold of his heart with your eyes

you can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
but theres only one authority
and thats the authority on high

tonight you got the power to take it tomorrow you won't have the power to
keep it.
west of the jordan east of the rock of gibraltar

oh where have you been my blue-eyed son
oh where have you been my darling young one
ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways
ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
and its a hard and its a hard its a hard and its a hard
and its a hard rains a-gonna fall
oh what did you see my blue-eyed son
oh what did you see my darling young one
i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
i saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin
i saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin
i saw a white ladder all covered with water
i saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains a-gonna fall
and what did you hear my blue-eyed son
and what did you hear my darling young one
i heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin
heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin
heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin
heard one person starve i heard many people laughin
heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains a-gonna fall
oh who did you meet my blue-eyed son
who did you meet my darling young one
i met a young child beside a dead pony
i met a white man who walked a black dog
i met a young woman whose body was burning
i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
i met one man who was wounded in love
i met another man who was wounded with hatred
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
its a hard rains a-gonna fall
oh whatll you do now my blue-eyed son
oh whatll you do now my darling young one
im a-goin back out fore the rain starts a-fallin
ill walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
where the people are many and their hands are all empty
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
where the executioners face is always well hidden
where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
where black is the color where none is the number
and ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
and reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinkin
but ill know my song well before i start singin
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
its a hard rains a-gonna fall

well my hearts in the highlands gentle and fair
honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air
bluebelles blazing where the aberdeen waters flow
well my hearts in the highland
im gonna go there when i feel good enough to go
windows were shakin all night in my dreams
everything was exactly the way that it seems
woke up this morning and i looked at the same old page
same ol rat race
life in the same ol cage
i dont want nothing from anyone aint that much to take
wouldnt know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
i wish someone would come
and push back the clock for me
well my hearts in the highlands wherever i roam
thats where ill be when i get called home
the wind it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
well my hearts in the highland
i can only get there one step at a time
im listening to neil young i gotta turn up the sound
someones always yelling turn it down
feel like im drifting
drifting from scene to scene
im wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean
insanity is smashing up against my soul
you can say i was on anything but a roll
if i had a conscience well i just might blow my top
what would i do with it anyway
maybe take it to the pawn shop
my hearts in the highlands at the break of dawn
by the beautiful lake of the black swan
big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
well my hearts in the highlands
only place left to go
im in boston town in some restaurant
i got no idea what i want
well maybe i do but im just really not sure
waitress comes over
nobody in the place but me and her
it must be a holiday theres nobody around
she studies me closely as i sit down
she got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
she says whatll it be
i say i dont know you got any soft boiled eggs
she looks at me says id bring you some
but were out of m you picked the wrong time to come
then she says i know youre an artist draw a picture of me!
i say i would if i could but

i say all right i know but i dont have my drawing book!

i say yes i could but
i dont know where my pencil is at!
she pulls one out from behind her ear
she says all right now go ahead draw me im standing right here
i make a few lines and i show it for her to see
well she takes the napkin and throws it back
and says that dont look a thing like me!
i said oh kind miss it most certainly does

well i say how would you know and what would it matter anyway
well she says you just dont seem like you do!
i said youre way wrong
she says which ones have you read then i say i read erica jong!
she goes away for a minute
and i slide up out of my chair
i step outside back to the busy street but nobodys going anywhere
well my hearts in the highlands with the horses and hounds
way up in the border country far from the towns
with the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
my hearts in the highlands
cant see any other way to go
every day is the same thing out the door
feel further away than ever before
some things in life it gets too late to learn
well im lost somewhere
i must have made a few bad turns
i see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
theyre drinking and dancing wearing bright-colored clothes
all the young men with their young women looking so good
well id trade places with any of them
in a minute if i could
im crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
talking to myself in a monologue
i think what i need might be a full-length leather coat
somebody just asked me
if i registered to vote
the sun is beginning to shine on me
but its not like the sun that used to be
the partys over and theres less and less to say
i got new eyes
everything looks far away
well my hearts in the highlands at the break of day
over the hills and far away
theres a way to get there and ill figure it out somehow
but im already there in my mind
and thats good enough for now
oh god said to abraham kill me a son

i'm weepin' for my babies three.
oh what are those hills yonder my love
they look as white as snow
those are the hill of heaven my love
you and i'll never know
oh what are those hills yonder my love
they look as dark as night
those are the hills of hell-fire my love
where you and i will unite
oh twice around went the gallant ship
i'm sure it was not three
when the ship all of a sudden it sprung a leak
and it drifted to the bottom of the sea
there is a house down in new orleans they call the rising sun
and it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me oh god i'm one.
my mother was a tailor she sowed these new blue jeans
my sweetheart was a gambler lord down in new orleans.
now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
and the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
he fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
and the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town
oh tell my baby sister not to do what i have done
but shun that house in new orleans they call the rising sun.
well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
i'm going back to new orleans to wear that ball and chain.
i'm going back to new orleans my race is almost run
i'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun.
there is a house in new orleans they call the rising sun
and it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me oh god i'm one.
pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out my god they killed them all!
here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world
three bodies lyin there does patty see
and another man named bello movin around mysteriously
i didnt do it he says and he throws up his hands
i was only robbin the register i hope you understand
i saw them leavin he says and he stops
one of us had better call up the cops
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin
in the hot new jersey night
meanwhile far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson thats just the way things go
if youre black you might as well not show up on the street
less you wanna draw the heat
alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin around
he said i saw two men runnin out they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said wait a minute boys this ones not dead
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men
four in the mornin and they haul rubin in
take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dyin eye
says whad you bring him in here for he aint the guy!
yes heres the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world
four months later the ghettos are in flame
rubins in south america fightin for his name
while arthur dexter bradleys still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin the screws to him lookin for somebody to blame
remember that murder that happened in a bar
remember you said you saw the getaway car
you think youd like to play ball with the law
think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin that night
dont forget that you are white
arthur dexter bradley said im really not sure
cops said a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job and were talkin to your friend bello
now you dont wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow
youll be doin society a favor
that sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he aint no gentleman jim
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
its my work hed say and i do it for pay
and when its over id just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man into a mouse
all of rubins cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance
the judge made rubins witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed
rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder one guess who testified
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers they all went along for the ride
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fools hand
to see him obviously framed
couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell
thats the story of the hurricane
but it wont be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time hes done
put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world
i am a lonesome hobo
without family or friends
where another mans life might begin
thats exactly where mine ends
i have tried my hand at bribery
blackmail and deceit
and ive served time for evrything
cept beggin on the street
well once i was rather prosperous
there was nothing i did lack
i had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
and silk upon my back
but i did not trust my brother
i carried him to blame
which led me to my fatal doom
to wander off in shame
kind ladies and kind gentlemen
soon i will be gone
but let me just warn you all
before i do pass on
stay free from petty jealousies
live by no mans code
and hold your judgment for yourself
lest you wind up on this road
been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
look how sweet she sleeps how free must be her dreams
in another lifetime she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
to some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
i and i
in creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other no man sees my face and lives
think ill go out and go for a walk
not much happenin here nothin ever does
besides if she wakes up now shell just want me to talk
i got nothin to say specially about whatever was
i and i
in creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other no man sees my face and lives
took an untrodden path once where the swift dont win the race
it goes to the worthy who can divide the word of truth
took a stranger to teach me to look into justices beautiful face
and to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
i and i
in creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other no man sees my face and lives
outside of two men on a train platform theres nobody in sight
theyre waiting for spring to come smoking down the track
the world could come to an end tonight but thats all right
she should still be there sleepin when i get back
i and i
in creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other no man sees my face and lives
noontime and im still pushin myself along the road the darkest part
into the narrow lanes i cant stumble or stay put
someone else is speakin with my mouth but im listening only to my heart
ive made shoes for everyone even you while i still go barefoot
i and i
in creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other no man sees my face and lives
they ask me how i feel
and if my love is real
and how i know ill make it through
and they they look at me and frown
theyd like to drive me from this town
they dont want me around
cause i believe in you
they show me to the door
they say dont come back no more
cause i dont be like theyd like me to
and i walk out on my own
a thousand miles from home
but i dont feel alone
cause i believe in you
i believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
i believe in you even though we be apart
i believe in you even on the morning after
oh when the dawn is nearing
oh when the night is disappearing
oh this feeling is still here in my heart
dont let me drift too far
keep me where you are
where i will always be renewed
and that which youve given me today
is worth more than i could pay
and no matter what they say
i believe in you
i believe in you when winter turn to summer
i believe in you when white turn to black
i believe in you even though i be outnumbered
oh though the earth may shake me
oh though my friends forsake me
oh even that couldnt make me go back
dont let me change my heart
keep me set apart
from all the plans they do pursue
and i i dont mind the pain
dont mind the driving rain
i know i will sustain
cause i believe in you
i cant understand
she let go of my hand
an left me here facing the wall
id sure like t know
why she did go
but i cant get close t her at all
though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
she said she would never forget
but now mornins clear
its like i aint here
she just acts like we never have met
its all new t me
like some mystery
it could even be like a myth
yet its hard t think on
that shes the same one
that last night i was with
from darkness dreamsre deserted
am i still dreamin yet
i wish shed unlock
her voice once an talk
stead of acting like we never have met
if she aint feelin well
then why dont she tell
stead of turnin her back t my face
without any doubt
she seems too far out
for me t return t her chase
though the night ran swirling an whirling
i remember her whispering yet
but evidently she dont
an evidently she wont
she just acts like we never have met
if i didnt have t guess
id gladly confess
t anything i mightve tried
if i was with er too long
or have done something wrong
i wish shed tell me what it is ill run an hide
though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
her mouth was watery and wet
but now something has changed
for she aint the same
she just acts like we never have met
im leavin today
ill be on my way
of this i cant say very much
but if you want me to
i can be just like you
an pretend that we never have touched
an if anybody asks me
is it easy to forget
ill say its easily done
you just pick anyone
an pretend that you never have met!
i dreamed i saw st. augustine
alive as you or me
tearing through these quarters
in the utmost misery
with a blanket underneath his arm
and a coat of solid gold
searching for the very souls
whom already have been sold
arise arise he cried so loud
in a voice without restraint
come out ye gifted kings and queens
and hear my sad complaint
no martyr is among ye now
whom you can call your own
so go on your way accordingly
but know youre not alone
i dreamed i saw st. augustine
alive with fiery breath
and i dreamed i was amongst the ones
that put him out to death
oh i awoke in anger
so alone and terrified
i put my fingers against the glass
and bowed my head and cried
well i'm looking the world over
looking far off into the east
and i see my baby coming
she's walking with the village priest
i feel a change coming on
and the last part of the day is already gone
we got so much in common
we strive for the same old ends
and i just can't wait
wait for us to become friends
i feel a change coming on
and the fourth part of the day is already gone
life is for love
and they say that love is blind
if you want to live easy
baby pack your clothes with mine
i feel a change coming on
and the fourth part of the day is already gone
well now what's the use in dreamin'
you got better things to do
dreams never did work for me anyway
even when they did come true
you are as whorish as ever
baby you could start a fire
i must be losing my mind
you're the object of my desire
i feel a change coming on
and the fourth part of the day is already gone
i'm listening to billy joe shaver
and i'm reading james joyce
some people they tell me
i got the blood of the land in my voice
everybody got all the money
everybody got all the beautiful clothes
everybody got all the flowers
i don't have one single rose
i feel a change coming on
and the fourth part of the day is already gone
i pity the poor immigrant
who wishes he wouldve stayed home
who uses all his power to do evil
but in the end is always left so alone
that man whom with his fingers cheats
and who lies with evry breath
who passionately hates his life
and likewise fears his death
i pity the poor immigrant
whose strength is spent in vain
whose heaven is like ironsides
whose tears are like rain
who eats but is not satisfied
who hears but does not see
who falls in love with wealth itself
and turns his back on me
i pity the poor immigrant
who tramples through the mud
who fills his mouth with laughing
and who builds his town with blood
whose visions in the final end
must shatter like the glass
i pity the poor immigrant
when his gladness comes to pass
im just average common too
im just like him the same as you
im everybodys brother and son
i aint different from anyone
it aint no use a-talking to me
its just the same as talking to you
i was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
i figured i was ready for cassius clay
i said fee fie fo fum cassius clay here i come

but if you think that ill let barry goldwater
move in next door and marry my daughter
you must think im crazy!
i wouldnt let him do it for all the farms in cuba
well i set my monkey on the log
and ordered him to do the dog
he wagged his tail and shook his head
and he went and did the cat instead
hes a weird monkey very funky
i sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
and my wig-hat was falling in my face
but they wouldnt let me on the tennis court
i got a woman shes so mean
she sticks my boots in the washing machine
sticks me with buckshot when im nude
puts bubblegum in my food
shes funny wants my money calls me honey
now i got a friend who spends his life
stabbing my picture with a bowie knife
dreams of strangling me with a scarf
when my name comes up he pretends to barf
ive got a million friends!
now they asked me to read a poem
at the sorority sisters home
i got knocked down and my head was swimmin
i wound up with the dean of women
yippee! im a poet and i know it
hope i dont blow it
im gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
so i look like a walking mountain range
and im gonna ride into omaha on a horse
out to the country club and the golf course
carry the new york times shoot a few holes blow their minds
now youre probably wondering by now
just what this song is all about
whats probably got you baffled more
is what this thing here is for
its nothing
its something i learned over in england
well i took me a woman late last night
is three-fourths drunk she looked uptight
she took off her wheel took off her bell
took off her wig said how do i smell
i hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .
out the window!
well sometimes i might get drunk
walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk
dont hurt me none dont hurt my pride
cause i got my little lady right by my side
(right there
proud as can be)
is out there paintin on the old woodshed
when a can a black paint it fell on my head
i went down to scrub and rub
but i had to sit in back of the tub
(cost a quarter
and i had to get out quick . . .
someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)
well my telephone rang it would not stop
its president kennedy callin me up
he said my friend bob what do we need to make the country grow
i said my friend john brigitte bardot
anita ekberg
sophia loren
(put em all in the same room with ernest borgnine!)
well i got a woman sleeps on a cot
she yells and hollers and squeals a lot
licks my face and tickles my ear
bends me over and buys me beer
(shes a honeymooner
a june crooner
a spoon feeder
and a natural leader)
oh there aint no use in me workin so heavy
i got a woman who works on the levee
pumping that water up to her neck
every week she sends me a monthly check
(shes a humdinger
folk singer
dead ringer
for a thing-a-muh jigger)
late one day in the middle of the week
eyes were closed i was half asleep
i chased me a woman up the hill
right in the middle of an air-raid drill
it was little bo peep!
(i jumped a fallout shelter
i jumped a bean stalk
i jumped a ferris wheel)
now the man on the stand he wants my vote
hes a-runnin for office on the ballot note
hes out there preachin in front of the steeple
tellin me he loves all kinds-a people
(hes eatin bagels
hes eatin pizza
hes eatin chitlins
hes eatin bullshit!)
oh set me down on a television floor
ill flip the channel to number four
out of the shower comes a grown-up man
with a bottle of hair oil in his hand
(its that greasy kid stuff
what i want to know mr. football man is
what do you do about willy mays and yul brynner
charles de gaulle
and robert louis stevenson)
well the funniest woman i ever seen
was the great-granddaughter of mr. clean
she takes about fifteen baths a day
wants me to grow a cigar on my face
(shes a little bit heavy!)
well ask me why im drunk alla time
it levels my head and eases my mind
i just walk along and stroll and sing
i see better days and i do better things
(i catch dinosaurs
i make love to elizabeth taylor . . .
catch hell from richard burton!)
they say evrything can be replaced
yet evry distance is not near
so i remember evry face
of evry man who put me here
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now any day now
i shall be released
they say evry man needs protection
they say evry man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection
some place so high above this wall
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now any day now
i shall be released
standing next to me in this lonely crowd
is a man who swears hes not to blame
all day long i hear him shout so loud
crying out that he was framed
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now any day now
i shall be released
i once held her in my arms
she said she would always stay
but i was cruel
i treated her like a fool
i threw it all away
once i had mountains in the palm of my hand
and rivers that ran through evry day
i must have been mad
i never knew what i had
until i threw it all away
love is all there is it makes the world go round
love and only love it cant be denied
no matter what you think about it
you just wont be able to do without it
take a tip from one whos tried
so if you find someone that gives you all of her love
take it to your heart dont let it stray
for one thing thats certain
you will surely be a-hurtin
if you throw it all away
well the rainman comes with his magic wand
and the judge says mona cant have no bond
and the walls collide mona cries
and the rainman leaves in the wolfmans disguise
i wanna be your lover baby i wanna be your man
i wanna be your lover baby

she gets all messed up and she faints –
thats cause shes so obvious and you aint
i wanna be your lover baby i wanna be your man
i wanna be your lover baby
i dont wanna be hers i wanna be yours
the guilty undertaker sighs
the lonesome organ grinder cries
the silver saxophones say i should refuse you
the cracked bells and washed-out horns
blow into my face with scorn
but its not that way
i wasnt born to lose you
i want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you
the drunken politician leaps
upon the street where mothers weep
and the saviors who are fast asleep they wait for you
and i wait for them to interrupt
me drinkin from my broken cup
and ask me to
open up the gate for you
i want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you
how all my fathers theyve gone down
true love theyve been without it
but all their daughters put me down
cause i dont think about it
well i return to the queen of spades
and talk with my chambermaid
she knows that im not afraid to look at her
she is good to me
and theres nothing she doesnt see
she knows where id like to be
but it doesnt matter
i want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you
now your dancing child with his chinese suit
he spoke to me i took his flute

because he took you for a ride
and because time was on his side
and because i . . .
i want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you
as i went out one morning
to breathe the air around tom paines
i spied the fairest damsel
that ever did walk in chains
i offerd her my hand
she took me by the arm
i knew that very instant
she meant to do me harm
depart from me this moment
i told her with my voice
said she but i dont wish to
said i but you have no choice
i beg you sir she pleaded
from the corners of her mouth
i will secretly accept you
and together well fly south
just then tom paine himself
came running from across the field
shouting at this lovely girl
and commanding her to yield
and as she was letting go her grip
up tom paine did run
im sorry sir he said to me
im sorry for what shes done
well your clock is gonna stop

someones got it in for me theyre planting stories in the press
whoever it is i wish theyd cut it out but when they will i can only guess
they say i shot a man named gray and took his wife to italy
she inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
i cant help it if im lucky
people see me all the time and they just cant remember how to act
their minds are filled with big ideas images and distorted facts
even you yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
i couldnt believe after all these years you didnt know me better than that
sweet lady
idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth
blowing down the backroads headin south
idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth
youre an idiot babe
its a wonder that you still know how to breathe
i ran into the fortune-teller who said beware of lightning that might strike
i havent known peace and quiet for so long i cant remember what its like
theres a lone soldier on the cross smoke pourin out of a boxcar door
you didnt know it you didnt think it could be done in the final end he won the wars
after losin every battle
i woke up on the roadside daydreamin bout the way things sometimes are
visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin me see stars
you hurt the ones that i love best and cover up the truth with lies
one day youll be in the ditch flies buzzin around your eyes
blood on your saddle
idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb
blowing through the curtains in your room
idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth
youre an idiot babe
its a wonder that you still know how to breathe
it was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
you tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasnt enough to change my heart
now everythings a little upside down as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
whats good is bad whats bad is good youll find out when you reach the top
youre on the bottom
i noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
i cant remember your face anymore your mouth has changed your eyes
dont look into mine
the priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building burned
i waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the
springtime turned
slowly into autumn
idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull
from the grand coulee dam to the capitol
idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth
youre an idiot babe
its a wonder that you still know how to breathe
i cant feel you anymore i cant even touch the books youve read
every time i crawl past your door i been wishin i was somebody else instead
down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy
i followed you beneath the stars hounded by your memory
and all your ragin glory
i been double-crossed now for the very last time and now im finally free
i kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
youll never know the hurt i suffered nor the pain i rise above
and ill never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love
and it makes me feel so sorry
idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats
blowing through the letters that we wrote
idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves
were idiots babe
its a wonder we can even feed ourselves
if dogs run free then why not we
across the swooping plain
my ears hear a symphony
of two mules trains and rain
the best is always yet to come
thats what they explain to me
just do your thing youll be king
if dogs run free
if dogs run free why not me
across the swamp of time
my mind weaves a symphony
and tapestry of rhyme
oh winds which rush my tale to thee
so it may flow and be
to each his own its all unknown
if dogs run free
if dogs run free then what must be
must be and that is all
true love can make a blade of grass
stand up straight and tall
in harmony with the cosmic sea
true love needs no company
it can cure the soul it can make it whole
if dogs run free
if not for you
babe i couldnt find the door
couldnt even see the floor
id be sad and blue
if not for you
if not for you
babe id lay awake all night
wait for the mornin light
to shine in through
but it would not be new
if not for you
if not for you
my sky would fall
rain would gather too
without your love id be nowhere at all
id be lost if not for you
and you know its true
if not for you
my sky would fall
rain would gather too
without your love id be nowhere at all
oh! what would i do
if not for you
if not for you
winter would have no spring
couldnt hear the robin sing
i just wouldnt have a clue
anyway it wouldnt ring true
if not for you
if you ever go to houston
better walk right
keep your hands in your pockets
and your gun-belt tight
you'll be asking for trouble
if you're lookin' for a fight
if you ever go to houston
boy you better walk right
if you're ever down there
on bagby and lamar
you better watch out for
the man with the shining star
better know where you're going
or stay where you are
if you're ever down there
on bagby and lamar
i know these streets
i've been here before
i nearly got killed here
during the mexican war
something always
keeps me coming back for more
i know these streets
i've been here before
if you ever go to dallas
say hello to mary anne
say i'm still pullin' on the trigger
hangin' on the best i can
if you see her sister lucy
say i'm sorry i'm not there
tell her other sister betsy
to pray the sinner's prayer
i got a restless fever
burnin' in my brain
got to keep ridin' forward

burnin' in my brain

if you help me find her
you can be my pal
mr. policeman

i want to be with you gal
if you want to be with me
but if you got to go

it aint that im questionin you
to take part in any quiz
its just that i aint got no watch
an you keep askin me what time it is
but if you got to go
its all right
but if you got to go go now
or else you gotta stay all night
i am just a poor boy baby
lookin to connect
but i certainly dont want you thinkin
that i aint got any respect
but if you got to go
its all right
but if you got to go go now
or else you gotta stay all night

and a guilty conscience too
if i kept you from anything
that you really wanted to do
but if you got to go
its all right
but if you got to go go now
or else you gotta stay all night
it aint that im wantin
anything you never gave before
its just that ill be sleepin soon
itll be too dark for you to find the door
but if you got to go
its all right
but if you got to go go now
or else you gotta stay all night
if you see her say hello she might be in tangier
she left here last early spring is livin' there i hear
say for me that im all right though things get kind of slow
she might think that ive forgotten her dont tell her it isnt so
we had a falling-out like lovers often will
and to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
and though our separation it pierced me to the heart
she still lives inside of me we've never been apart
if you get close to her kiss her once for me
i always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
oh whatever makes her happy i won't stand in the way
though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night i tried to make her stay
i see a lot of people as i make the rounds
and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town
and ive never gotten used to it ive just learned to turn it off
either i'm too sensitive or else i'm gettin' soft
sundown yellow moon i replay the past
i know every scene by heart they all went by so fast
if shes passin back this way i'm not that hard to find
tell her she can look me up if she's got the time
close your eyes close the door
you dont have to worry anymore
ill be your baby tonight
shut the light shut the shade
you dont have to be afraid
ill be your baby tonight
well that mockingbirds gonna sail away

that big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
but were gonna let it

but if i can save you any time

the conductor hes weary
hes still stuck on the line
but if i can save you any time
come on give it to me
ill keep it with mine
ill remember you
when ive forgotten all the rest
you to me were true
you to me were the best
when there is no more
you cut to the core
quicker than anyone i knew
when im all alone
in the great unknown
ill remember you
ill remember you
at the end of the trail
i had so much left to do
i had so little time to fail
theres some people that
you dont forget
even though youve only seen m one time or two
when the roses fade
and im in the shade
ill remember you
didnt i didnt i try to love you
didnt i didnt i try to care
didnt i sleep didnt i weep beside you
with the rain blowing in your hair
ill remember you
when the wind blows through the piney wood
it was you who came right through
it was you who understood
though id never say
that i done it the way
that youd have liked me to
in the end
my dear sweet friend
ill remember you
i married isis on the fifth day of may
but i could not hold on to her very long
so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away
for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong
i came to a high place of darkness and light
the dividing line ran through the center of town
i hitched up my pony to a post on the right
went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down
a man in the corner approached me for a match
i knew right away he was not ordinary
he said are you lookin for somethin easy to catch
i said i got no money. he said that aint necessary
we set out that night for the cold in the north
i gave him my blanket he gave me his word
i said where are we goin he said wed be back by the fourth
i said thats the best news that ive ever heard
i was thinkin about turquoise i was thinkin about gold
i was thinkin about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace
as we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
i was thinkin about isis how she thought i was so reckless
how she told me that one day we would meet up again
and things would be different the next time we wed
if i only could hang on and just be her friend
i still cant remember all the best things she said
we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
he said theres a body im tryin to find
if i carry it out itll bring a good price
twas then that i knew what he had on his mind
the wind it was howlin and the snow was outrageous
we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
when he died i was hopin that it wasnt contagious
but i made up my mind that i had to go on
i broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
there was no jewels no nothin i felt id been had
when i saw that my partner was just bein friendly
when i took up his offer i must-a been mad
i picked up his body and i dragged him inside
threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover
i said a quick prayer and i felt satisfied
then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her
she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes
i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead
she said where ya been i said no place special
she said you look different. i said well not quite
she said you been gone. i said thats only natural
she said you gonna stay i said yeah i jes might
isis oh isis you mystical child
what drives me to you is what drives me insane
i still can remember the way that you smiled
on the fifth day of may in the drizzlin rain
go way from my window
leave at your own chosen speed
im not the one you want babe
im not the one you need
you say youre lookin for someone
never weak but always strong
to protect you an defend you
whether you are right or wrong
someone to open each and every door
but it aint me babe
no no no it aint me babe
it aint me youre lookin for babe
go lightly from the ledge babe
go lightly on the ground
im not the one you want babe
i will only let you down
you say youre lookin for someone
who will promise never to part
someone to close his eyes for you
someone to close his heart
someone who will die for you an more
but it aint me babe
no no no it aint me babe
it aint me youre lookin for babe
go melt back into the night babe
everything inside is made of stone
theres nothing in here moving
an anyway im not alone
you say youre lookin' for someone
wholl pick you up each time you fall
to gather flowers constantly
an to come each time you call
a lover for your life an nothing more
but it aint me babe
no no no it aint me babe
it aint me youre lookin for babe
well i ride on a mailtrain baby
cant buy a thrill
well ive been up all night baby
leanin on the windowsill
well if i die
on top of the hill
and if i dont make it
you know my baby will
dont the moon look good mama
shinin through the trees
dont the brakeman look good mama
flagging down the double e
dont the sun look good
goin down over the sea
dont my gal look fine
when shes comin after me
now the wintertime is coming
the windows are filled with frost
i went to tell everybody
but i could not get across
well i wanna be your lover baby
i dont wanna be your boss
dont say i never warned you
when your train gets lost
talk about me babe if you must
throw on the dirt pile on the dust
i'd do the same thing if i could
you know what they say they say it's all good
all good
it's all good
big politician telling lies
restaurant kitchen all full of flies
don't make a bit of difference don't see why it should
but it's all right 'cause it's all good
it's all good
it's all good
wives are leavin' their husbands they beginning to roam
they leave the party and they never get home
i wouldn't change it even if i could
you know what they say man it's all good
it's all good
all good
brick by brick they tear you down
a teacup of water is enough to drown
you ought to know if they could they would
whatever going down it's all good
all good
say it's all good
people in the country people on the land
some of them so sick they can hardly stand
everybody would move away if they could
it's hard to believe but it's all good
yeah
the widow's cry the orphan's plea
everywhere you look more misery
come along with me babe i wish you would
you know what i'm sayin' it's all good
all good
i said it's all good
all good
cold-blooded killer stalking the town
cop cars blinking something bad going down
buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
but there's nothing to worry about 'cause it's all good
it's all good
they say it's all good
i'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
this time tomorrow i'll be rolling in your place
i wouldn't change a thing even if i could
you know what they say they say it's all good
it's all good
you must leave now take what you need you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun
look out the saints are comin through
and its all over now baby blue
the highway is for gamblers better use your sense
take what you have gathered from coincidence
the empty-handed painter from your streets
is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
this sky too is folding under you
and its all over now baby blue
all your seasick sailors they are rowing home
all your reindeer armies are all going home
the lover who just walked out your door
has taken all his blankets from the floor
the carpet too is moving under you
and its all over now baby blue
leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you
forget the dead youve left they will not follow you
the vagabond whos rapping at your door
is standing in the clothes that you once wore
strike another match go start anew
and its all over now baby blue
darkness at the break of noon
shadows even the silver spoon
the handmade blade the childs balloon
eclipses both the sun and moon
to understand you know too soon
there is no sense in trying
pointed threats they bluff with scorn
suicide remarks are torn
from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
plays wasted words proves to warn
that he not busy being born is busy dying
temptations page flies out the door
you follow find yourself at war
watch waterfalls of pity roar
you feel to moan but unlike before
you discover that youd just be one more
person crying
so dont fear if you hear
a foreign sound to your ear
its alright ma im only sighing
as some warn victory some downfall
private reasons great or small
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
to make all that should be killed to crawl
while others say dont hate nothing at all
except hatred
disillusioned words like bullets bark
as human gods aim for their mark
make everything from toy guns that spark
to flesh-colored christs that glow in the dark
its easy to see without looking too far
that not much is really sacred
while preachers preach of evil fates
teachers teach that knowledge waits
can lead to hundred-dollar plates
goodness hides behind its gates
but even the president of the united states
sometimes must have to stand naked
an though the rules of the road have been lodged
its only peoples games that you got to dodge
and its alright ma i can make it
advertising signs they con
you into thinking youre the one
that can do whats never been done
that can win whats never been won
meantime life outside goes on
all around you
you lose yourself you reappear
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear
alone you stand with nobody near
when a trembling distant voice unclear
startles your sleeping ears to hear
that somebody thinks they really found you
a question in your nerves is lit
yet you know there is no answer fit
to satisfy insure you not to quit
to keep it in your mind and not forget
that it is not he or she or them or it
that you belong to
although the masters make the rules
for the wise men and the fools
i got nothing ma to live up to
for them that must obey authority
that they do not respect in any degree
who despise their jobs their destinies
speak jealously of them that are free
cultivate their flowers to be
nothing more than something they invest in
while some on principles baptized
to strict party platform ties
social clubs in drag disguise
outsiders they can freely criticize
tell nothing except who to idolize
and then say god bless him
while one who sings with his tongue on fire
gargles in the rat race choir
bent out of shape from societys pliers
cares not to come up any higher
but rather get you down in the hole
that hes in
but i mean no harm nor put fault
on anyone that lives in a vault
but its alright ma if i cant please him
old lady judges watch people in pairs
limited in sex they dare
to push fake morals insult and stare
while money doesnt talk it swears
obscenity who really cares
propaganda all is phony
while them that defend what they cannot see
with a killers pride security
it blows the minds most bitterly
for them that think deaths honesty
wont fall upon them naturally
life sometimes must get lonely
my eyes collide head-on with stuffed
graveyards false gods i scuff
at pettiness which plays so rough
walk upside-down inside handcuffs
kick my legs to crash it off
say okay i have had enough what else can you show me
and if my thought-dreams could be seen
theyd probably put my head in a guillotine
but its alright ma its life and life only
well she's got jet pilot eyes from her hips on down.
all the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.
she's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.
she weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
she got all the downtown boys all at her command
but you've got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman
she's a man.
come and listen for a moment lads
and hear me tell my tale.
how across the sea from england
i was condemned to sail.
now the jury found me guilty
then says the judge says he
oh for life jim jones i'm sending you
across the stormy sea.
but take a tip before you ship
to join the iron gang.
don't get too gay in botany bay
or else you'll surely hang.
or else you'll surely hang says he.
and after that jim jones
it's high above on the gallows tree
the crows will pick your bones.
and our ship was high upon the sea
then pirates came along
but the soldiers on our convict ship
were full five hundred strong.
for they opened fire and somehow drove
that pirate ship away.
but i'd rather have joined that pirate ship
tan gone to botany bay.
with the storms ragin' round us
and the winds a-blowin' gale
i'd rather have drowned in misery
than gone to new south wales.
now it's day and night and the irons clang
and like poor galley slaves
we toil and toil and when we die
must fill dishonored graves
and it's by and by i'll slip my chains
well into the bush i'll go
and i'll join the bravest rankers there
jack donohue and co.
and some dark night when everything
is silent in the town
i'll shoot those tyrants one and all
i'll gun the flogger down.
oh i'll give the land a little shock
remember what i say
and they'll yet regret they've sent jim jones
in chains to botany bay.
born in red hook brooklyn in the year of who knows when
opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
always on the outside of whatever side there was
when they asked him why it had to be that way well he answered
just because
larry was the oldest joey was next to last
they called joe crazy the baby they called kid blast
some say they lived off gambling and runnin numbers too
it always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
joey joey
king of the streets child of clay
joey joey
what made them want to come and blow you away
there was talk they killed their rivals but the truth was far from that
no one ever knew for sure where they were really at
when they tried to strangle larry joey almost hit the roof
he went out that night to seek revenge thinkin he was bulletproof
the war broke out at the break of dawn it emptied out the streets
joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
they stashed them away in a basement called them amateurs
the hostages were tremblin when they heard a man exclaim
lets blow this place to kingdom come let con edison take the blame
but joey stepped up he raised his hand said were not those kind of men
its peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again
joey joey
king of the streets child of clay
joey joey
what made them want to come and blow you away
the police department hounded him they called him mr. smith
they got him on conspiracy they were never sure who with
what time is it said the judge to joey when they met
five to ten said joey. the judge says thats exactly what you get
he did ten years in attica reading nietzsche and wilhelm reich
they threw him in the hole one time for tryin to stop a strike
his closest friends were black men cause they seemed to understand
what its like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
when they let him out in 71 hed lost a little weight
but he dressed like jimmy cagney and i swear he did look great
he tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
to the boss he said i have returned and now i want whats mine
joey joey
king of the streets child of clay
joey joey
why did they have to come and blow you away
it was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
im around too many children hed say they should never know of one
yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
emptied out the register said tell em it was crazy joe
one day they blew him down in a clam bar in new york
he could see it comin through the door as he lifted up his fork
he pushed the table over to protect his family
then he staggered out into the streets of little italy
joey joey
king of the streets child of clay
joey joey
what made them want to come and blow you away
sister jacqueline and carmela and mother mary all did weep
i heard his best friend frankie say he aint dead hes just asleep
then i saw the old mans limousine head back towards the grave
i guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
the sun turned cold over president street and the town of brooklyn mourned
they said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
and someday if gods in heaven overlookin his preserve
i know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve
joey joey
king of the streets child of clay
joey joey
what made them want to come and blow you away
john brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
his mama sure was proud of him!
he stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
his mamas face broke out all in a grin
oh son you look so fine im glad youre a son of mine
you make me proud to know you hold a gun
do what the captain says lots of medals you will get
and well put them on the wall when you come home
as that old train pulled out johns ma began to shout
tellin evryone in the neighborhood:
thats my son thats about to go hes a soldier now you know
she made well sure her neighbors understood
she got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
as she showed them to the people from next door
and she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
and these things you called a good old-fashioned war
oh! good old-fashioned war!
then the letters ceased to come for a long time they did not come
they ceased to come for about ten months or more
then a letter finally came saying go down and meet the train
your sons a-coming home from the war
she smiled and went right down she looked everywhere around
but she could not see her soldier son in sight
but as all the people passed she saw her son at last
when she did she could hardly believe her eyes
oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
and he wore a metal brace around his waist
he whispered kind of slow in a voice she did not know
while she couldnt even recognize his face!
oh! lord! not even recognize his face
oh tell me my darling son pray tell me what they done
how is it you come to be this way
he tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
and the mother had to turn her face away
dont you remember ma when i went off to war
you thought it was the best thing i could do
i was on the battleground you were home . . . acting proud
you wasnt there standing in my shoes
oh and i thought when i was there god what am i doing here
im a-tryin to kill somebody or die tryin
but the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
and i saw that his face looked just like mine
oh! lord! just like mine!
and i couldnt help but think through the thunder rolling and stink
that i was just a puppet in a play
and through the roar and smoke this string is finally broke
and a cannonball blew my eyes away
as he turned away to walk his ma was still in shock
at seein the metal brace that helped him stand
but as he turned to go he called his mother close
and he dropped his medals down into her hand
john wesley harding
was a friend to the poor
he travled with a gun in evry hand
all along this countryside
he opened many a door
but he was never known
to hurt an honest man
twas down in chaynee county
a time they talk about
with his lady by his side
he took a stand
and soon the situation there
was all but straightened out
for he was always known
to lend a helping hand
all across the telegraph
his name it did resound
but no charge held against him
could they prove
and there was no man around
who could track or chain him down
he was never known
to make a foolish move
standing on the waters casting your bread
while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
distant ships sailing into the mist
you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
freedom just around the corner for you
but with the truth so far off what good will it do
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
so swiftly the sun sets in the sky
you rise up and say goodbye to no one
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
both of their futures so full of dread you dont show one
shedding off one more layer of skin
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
youre a man of the mountains you can walk on the clouds
manipulator of crowds youre a dream twister
youre going to sodom and gomorrah
but what do you care aint nobody there would want to marry your sister
friend to the martyr a friend to the woman of shame
you look into the fiery furnace see the rich man without any name
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well the book of leviticus and deuteronomy
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
in the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
michelangelo indeed couldve carved out your features
resting in the fields far from the turbulent space
half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well the riflemans stalking the sick and the lame
preacherman seeks the same wholl get there first is uncertain
nightsticks and water cannons tear gas padlocks
molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
false-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
only a matter of time til night comes steppin in
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
its a shadowy world skies are slippery grey
a woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
hell put the priest in his pocket put the blade to the heat
take the motherless children off the street
and place them at the feet of a harlot
oh jokerman you know what he wants
oh jokerman you dont show any response
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh oh oh jokerman
well you're comin' down high street walkin' in the sun
you make the dead man rise and holler she's the one
jolene jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen
well it's a long old highway don't ever end
i've got a saturday night special i'm back again
i'll sleep by your door lay my life on the line
you probably don't know but i'm gonna make you mine
jolene jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen
i keep my hands in my pocket i'm movin' along
people think they know but they're all wrong
you're something nice i'm gonna grab my dice
i can't say i haven't paid the price
jolene jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen
well i found out the hard way i've had my fill
you can't find somebody with his back to a hill
those big brown eyes they set off a spark
when you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
jolene jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen
when youre lost in the rain in juarez
and its eastertime too
and your gravity fails
and negativity dont pull you through
dont put on any airs
when youre down on rue morgue avenue
they got some hungry women there
and they really make a mess outta you
now if you see saint annie
please tell her thanks a lot
i cannot move
my fingers are all in a knot
i dont have the strength
to get up and take another shot
and my best friend my doctor
wont even say what it is ive got
sweet melinda
the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
she speaks good english
and she invites you up into her room
and youre so kind
and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice
and leaves you howling at the moon
up on housing project hill
its either fortune or fame
you must pick up one or the other
though neither of them are to be what they claim
if youre lookin to get silly
you better go back to from where you came
because the cops dont need you
and man they expect the same
now all the authorities
they just stand around and boast
how they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
into leaving his post
and picking up angel who
just arrived here from the coast
who looked so fine at first
but left looking just like a ghost
i started out on burgundy
but soon hit the harder stuff
everybody said theyd stand behind me
when the game got rough
but the joke was on me
there was nobody even there to call my bluff
im going back to new york city
i do believe ive had enough
nobody feels any pain
tonight as i stand inside the rain
evrybody knows
that babys got new clothes
but lately i see her ribbons and her bows
have fallen from her curls
she takes just like a woman yes she does
she makes love just like a woman yes she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl
queen mary shes my friend
yes i believe ill go see her again
nobody has to guess
that baby cant be blessed
till she sees finally that shes like all the rest
with her fog her amphetamine and her pearls
she takes just like a woman yes she does
she makes love just like a woman yes she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl
it was raining from the first
and i was dying there of thirst
so i came in here
and your long-time curse hurts
but whats worse
is this pain in here
i cant stay in here
aint it clear that—
i just cant fit
yes i believe its time for us to quit
when we meet again
introduced as friends
please dont let on that you knew me when
i was hungry and it was your world
ah you fake just like a woman yes you do
you make love just like a woman yes you do
then you ache just like a woman
but you break just like a little girl
the winter wind is a blowing strong
my hands have got no gloves
i wish to my soul that i could see
the girl i'm a-thinking of
don't you remember me babe
i remember you quite well
you caused me to leave old kingsport town
with a high sheriff on my trail
high sheriff on my trail boys
high sheriff on my trail
all because i'm falling for
a curly-headed dark-eyed girl
who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
and sandy colored skin
who's a-gonna kiss your menphis lips
when i'm out in the wind
when i'm out in the wind babe
when i'm out in the wind
who's a-gonna kiss your memphis mouth
when i'm out in the wind
who's a-gonna walk you side by side
and tell you everything's alright
who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
and not just in the night
who's a-gonna walk you side by side
who's a-gonna be your man
who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
and hold your bad luck hand
hold your bad luck hand babe
hold your bad luck hand
who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
and who's a-gonna be your man
the winter wind is a blowing strong
my hands have got no gloves

mama put my guns in the ground
i cant shoot them anymore
that long black cloud is comin down
i feel like im knockin on heavens door
knock knock knockin on heavens door
knock knock knockin on heavens door
knock knock knockin on heavens door
knock knock knockin on heavens door
when yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
when you think you're too old too young too smart or too dumb
when yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
in a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
no matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
if the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
if the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
and the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
and yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
and the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
and yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
and you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
and lonesome comes up as down goes the day
and tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
and you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
and yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'
and yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
and yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
and the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
and the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
and yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
and yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
and to yourself you sometimes say
i never knew it was gonna be this way
why didn't they tell me the day i was born
and you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
and you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
and yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
and the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
and yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
and yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
and yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
and you need it badly but it lays on the street
and yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
and you think yer ears might a been hurt
or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
and you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
when you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
and all the time you were holdin' three queens
and it's makin you mad it's makin' you mean
like in the middle of life magazine
bouncin' around a pinball machine
and there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
that somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
but it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
and it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
and no matter how you try you just can't say it
and yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it
and yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
and yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
and the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
and his jaws start closin with you underneath
and yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
and you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
and you say to yourself just what am i doin'
on this road i'm walkin' on this trail i'm turnin'
on this curve i'm hanging
on this pathway i'm strolling in the space i'm taking
in this air i'm inhaling
am i mixed up too much am i mixed up too hard
why am i walking where am i running
what am  i saying what am i knowing
on this guitar i'm playing on this banjo i'm frailin'
on this mandolin i'm strummin' in the song i'm singin'
in the tune i'm hummin' in the words i'm writin'
in the words that i'm thinkin'
in this ocean of hours i'm  all the time drinkin'
who am i helping what am i breaking
what am i giving what am i taking
but you try with your whole soul best
never to think these thoughts and never to let
them kind of thoughts gain ground
or make yer heart pound
but then again you know why they're around
just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
and you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
and you jump from yer bed from yer last chapter of dreamin'
and you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
if that was you in the dream that was screaming
and you know that it's something special you're needin'
and you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
and no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
and you need something special
yeah you need something special all right
you need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
to shoot you someplace and shoot you back
you need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
that's been banging and booming and blowing forever
that knows yer troubles a hundred times over
you need a greyhound bus that don't bar no race
that won't laugh at yer looks
your voice or your face
and by any number of bets in the book
will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
you need something to open up a new door
to show you something you seen before
but overlooked a hundred times or more
you need something to open your eyes
you need something to make it known
that it's you and no one else that owns
that spot that yer standing that space that you're sitting
that the world ain't got you beat
that it ain't got you licked
it can't get you crazy no matter how many
times you might get kicked
you need something special all right
you need something special to give you hope
but hope's just a word
that maybe you said or maybe you heard
on some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
but that's what you need man and you need it bad
and yer trouble is you know it too good
cause you look an' you start getting the chills
cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
and it ain't on macy's window sill
and it ain't on no rich kid's road map
and it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
and it ain't made in no hollywood wheat germ
and it ain't on that dimlit stage
with that half-wit comedian on it
ranting and raving and taking yer money
and you thinks it's funny
no you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
and it ain't in the seats of a supper club
and sure as hell you're bound to tell
that no matter how hard you rub
you just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
no and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
and it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
and it ain't in no cardboard-box house
or down any movie star's blouse
and you can't find it on the golf course
and uncle remus can't tell you and neither can santa claus
and it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
and it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
and it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
that come knockin' and tappin' in christmas wrappin'
sayin' ain't i pretty and ain't i cute and look at my skin
look at my skin shine look at my skin glow
look at my skin laugh look at my skin cry
when you can't even sense if they got any insides
these people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
no you'll not now or no other day
find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥
and inside it the people made of molasses
that every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
and it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
who breathe and burp and bend and crack
and before you can count from one to ten
do it all over again but this time behind yer back
my friend
the ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
and play games with each other in their sand-box world
and you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
that run around gallant
and make all rules for the ones that got talent
and it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
and think they're foolin' you
the ones who jump on the wagon
just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
to get their kicks get out of it quick
and make all kinds of money and chicks
and you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
sayin' christ do i gotta be like that
ain't there no one here that knows where i'm at
ain't there no one here that knows how i feel
good god almighty
that stuff ain't real
no but that ain't yer game it ain't even yer race
you can't hear yer name you can't see yer face
you gotta look some other place
and where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
where do you look for this oil well gushin'
where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
where do you look for this hope that you know is there
and out there somewhere
and your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
you can touch and twist
and turn two kinds of doorknobs
you can either go to the church of your choice
or you can go to brooklyn state hospital
you'll find god in the church of your choice
you'll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital
and though it's only my opinion
i may be right or wrong
you'll find them both
in the grand canyon
at sundown
lay down your weary tune lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum
struck by the sounds before the sun
i knew the night had gone
the morning breeze like a bugle blew
against the drums of dawn
lay down your weary tune lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum
the ocean wild like an organ played
the seaweeds wove its strands
the crashin waves like cymbals clashed
against the rocks and sands
lay down your weary tune lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum
i stood unwound beneath the skies
and clouds unbound by laws
the cryin rain like a trumpet sang
and asked for no applause
lay down your weary tune lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum
the last of leaves fell from the trees
and clung to a new loves breast
the branches bare like a banjo played
to the winds that listened best
i gazed down in the rivers mirror
and watched its winding strum
the water smooth ran like a hymn
and like a harp did hum
lay down your weary tune lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum

lenny bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
never did get any golden globe award never made it to synanon
he was an outlaw thats for sure

lenny bruce is gone but his spirits livin on and on
maybe he had some problems maybe some things that he couldnt work out
but he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin about
never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies heads
he just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
hes on some other shore he didnt wanna live anymore
lenny bruce is dead but he didnt commit any crime
he just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
i rode with him in a taxi once
only for a mile and a half seemed like it took a couple of months
lenny bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him gone
they said that he was sick cause he didnt play by the rules
he just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
they stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
he fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
lenny bruce was bad he was the brother that you never had

some people still sleepin' some people are wide awake
man thinks cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
and if things dont change soon he will
oh man has invented his doom
first step was touching the moon
now theres a woman on my block
she just sit there as the night grows still
she say who gonna take away his license to kill
now they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
and they set him on a path where hes bound to get ill
then they bury him with stars
sell his body like they do used cars
now theres a woman on my block
she just sit there facin the hill
she say who gonna take away his license to kill
now hes hell-bent for destruction hes afraid and confused
and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
all he believes are his eyes
and his eyes they just tell him lies
but theres a woman on my block
sitting there in a cold chill
she say who gonna take away his license to kill
ya may be a noisemaker spirit maker
heartbreaker backbreaker
leave no stone unturned
may be an actor in a plot
that might be all that you got
til your error you clearly learn
now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
and when he sees his reflection hes fulfilled
oh man is opposed to fair play
he wants it all and he wants it his way
now theres a woman on my block
she just sit there as the night grows still
she say who gonna take away his license to kill
the evening winds are still
i've lost the way and will
can't tell you where they went
i just know what they meant
i'm always on my guard
admitting life is hard
without you near me
the friend you used to be
so near and dear to me
you slipped so far away
where did we go a-stray
i pass the old schoolyard
admitting life is hard
without you near me
ever since the day
the day you went away
i felt that emptiness so wide
i don't know what's wrong or right
i just know i need strength to fight
strength to fight that world outside
since we've been out of touch
i haven't felt that much
from day to barren day
my heart stays locked away
i walk the boulevard
admitting life is hard
without you near me
the sun is sinking low
i guess it's time to go
i feel a chilly breeze
in place of memories
my dreams are locked and barred
admitting life is hard
without you near me
the festival was over the boys were all plannin for a fall
the cabaret was quiet except for the drillin in the wall
the curfew had been lifted and the gamblin wheel shut down
anyone with any sense had already left town
he was standin in the doorway lookin like the jack of hearts
he moved across the mirrored room set it up for everyone he said
then everyone commenced to do what they were doin before he turned their heads
then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins
then he moved into the corner face down like the jack of hearts
backstage the girls were playin five-card stud by the stairs
lily had two queens she was hopin for a third to match her pair
outside the streets were fillin up the window was open wide
a gentle breeze was blowin you could feel it from inside
lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts
big jim was no ones fool he owned the towns only diamond mine
he made his usual entrance lookin so dandy and so fine
with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts
rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
she slipped in through the side door lookin like a queen without a crown
she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
sorry darlin that im late but he didnt seem to hear
he was starin into space over at the jack of hearts
i know ive seen that face before big jim was thinkin to himself
maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf
but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim
and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him
starin at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts
lily was a princess she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
she did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she    smiled
shed come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs
with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
but shed never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts
the hangin judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
the drillin in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
it was known all around that lily had jims ring
and nothing would ever come between lily and the king
no nothin ever would except maybe the jack of hearts
rosemary started drinkin hard and seein her reflection in the knife
she was tired of the attention tired of playin the role of big jims wife
she had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide
was lookin to do just one good deed before she died
she was gazin to the future riding on the jack of hearts
lily washed her face took her dress off and buried it away
has your luck run out she laughed at him well i guess you must
have known it would someday
be careful not to touch the wall theres a brand-new coat of paint
im glad to see youre still alive youre lookin like a saint
down the hallway footsteps were comin for the jack of hearts
the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
theres something funny going on he said i can just feel it in the air
he went to get the hangin judge but the hangin judge was drunk
as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts
lilys arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch
she forgot all about the man she couldnt stand who hounded her so much
ive missed you so she said to him and he felt she was sincere
but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear
just another night in the life of the jack of hearts
no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
the door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
and big jim was standin there ya couldnt say surprised
rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes
she was with big jim but she was leanin to the jack of hearts
two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
and cleaned out the bank safe its said that they got off with quite a haul
in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
for one more member who had business back in town
but they couldnt go no further without the jack of hearts
the next day was hangin day the sky was overcast and black
big jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back
and rosemary on the gallows she didnt even blink
the hangin judge was sober he hadnt had a drink
the only person on the scene missin was the jack of hearts
the cabaret was empty now a sign said closed for repair
lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
she was thinkin bout her father who she very rarely saw
thinkin bout rosemary and thinkin about the law
but most of all she was thinkin bout the jack of hearts
1.oh where is little maggie
over yonder she stands
rifle on her shoulder
six-shooter in her hand.
2.how can i ever stand it
just to see them two blue eyes
shinin' like some diamonds

3.rather be in some lonely hollow
where the sun don't ever shine
than to see you be another man's darling
and to know that you'll never be mine.

william zanzinger killed poor hattie carroll
with a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
at a baltimore hotel society gathrin
and the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
as they rode him in custody down to the station
and booked william zanzinger for first-degree murder
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now aint the time for your tears
william zanzinger who at twenty-four years
owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
with rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
and high office relations in the politics of maryland
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and swear words and sneering and his tongue it was snarling
in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now aint the time for your tears
hattie carroll was a maid of the kitchen
she was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
and never sat once at the head of the table
and didnt even talk to the people at the table
who just cleaned up all the food from the table
and emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
got killed by a blow lay slain by a cane
that sailed through the air and came down through the room
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
and she never done nothing to william zanzinger
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now aint the time for your tears
in the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
to show that alls equal and that the courts are on the level
and that the strings in the books aint pulled and persuaded
and that even the nobles get properly handled
once that the cops have chased after and caught em
and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
stared at the person who killed for no reason
who just happened to be feelin that way without warnin
and he spoke through his cloak most deep and distinguished
and handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
william zanzinger with a six-month sentence
oh but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
bury the rag deep in your face
for nows the time for your tears
to preach of peace and brotherhood
oh what might be the cost!
a man he did it long ago
and they hung him on a cross
long ago far away
these things dont happen
no more nowadays
the chains of slaves they dragged the ground
with heads and hearts hung low
but it was during lincolns time
and it was long ago
long ago far away
things like that dont happen
no more nowadays
the war guns they went off wild
the whole world bled its blood
mens bodies floated on the edge
of oceans made of mud
long ago far away
those kind of things dont happen
no more nowadays
one man had much money
one man had not enough to eat
one man he lived just like a king
the other man begged on the street
long ago far away
things like that dont happen
no more nowadays
one man died of a knife so sharp
one man died from the bullet of a gun
one man died of a broken heart
to see the lynchin of his son
long ago far away
things like that dont happen
no more nowadays

long-distance operator
i believe im stranglin on this telephone wire
my parents raised me tenderly
i was their only son
my mind got mixed with ramblin
when i was all so young
and i left my home the first time
when i was twelve and one
im a long time a-comin maw
an ill be a long time gone
on the western side of texas
on the texas plains
i tried to find a job o work
but they said ls young of age
my eyes they burned when i heard
go home where you belong!
im a long time a-comin
an ill be a long time gone
i remember when is ramblin
around with the carnival trains
different towns different people
somehow theyre all the same
i remember childrens faces best
i remember travelin on
im a long time a-comin
ill be a long time gone
i once loved a fair young maid
an i aint too big to tell
if she broke my heart a single time
she broke it ten or twelve
i walked and talked all by myself
i did not tell no one
im a long time a-comin babe
an ill be a long time gone
many times by the highwayside
i tried to flag a ride
with bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
id watch the cars roll by
the empty air hung in my head
is thinkin all day long
im a long time a-comin
ill be a long time gone
you might see me on your crossroads
when im a-passin through
remember me how you wished to
as im a-driftin from your view
i aint got the time to think about it
i got too much to get done
well im a long time comin
an ill be a long time gone
if i cant help somebody
with a word or song
if i cant show somebody
they are travelin wrong
but i know i aint no prophet
an i aint no prophets son
im just a long time a-comin
an ill be a long time gone
so you can have your beauty
its skin deep and it only lies
and you can have your youth
itll rot before your eyes
just give to me my gravestone
with it clearly carved upon:
is a long time a-comin
an ill be a long time gone
for his age hes wise
hes got his mothers eyes
theres gladness in his heart
hes young and hes wild
my only prayer is if i cant be there
lord protect my child
as his youth now unfolds
he is centuries old
just to see him at play makes me smile
no matter what happens to me
no matter what my destiny
lord protect my child
the whole world is asleep
you can look at it and weep
few things you find are worthwhile
and though i dont ask for much
no material things to touch
lord protect my child
hes young and on fire
full of hope and desire
in a world thats been raped and defiled
if i fall along the way
and cant see another day
lord protect my child
therell be a time i hear tell
when all will be well
when god and man will be reconciled
but until men lose their chains
and righteousness reigns
lord protect my child
1.get down get down love henry she cried.
and stay all night with me.
i have gold chains and the finest i have
i'll apply them all to thee.
2.i can't get down and i shan't get down
or stay all night with thee.
some pretty little girl in cornersville
i love far better than thee.
3.he layed his head on a pillow of down.
kisses she gave him three.
with a penny knife that she held in her hand
she murdered mortal he.
instrumental
4.get well get well love henry  she cried
get well get well said she.
oh don't you see my own heart's blood
come flowin' down so free
5.she took him by his long yellow hair
and also by his feet.
she plunged him into well water where
it runs both cold and deep.
6.lie there lie there love henry she cried
til the flesh rots off your bones.
some pretty little girl in cornersville
will mourn for your return.
instrumental
7.hush up hush up my parrot she cried
and light on my right knee.
the doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
and hung on a willow tree.
9.i won't fly down i can't fly down
and light on your right knee.
a girl who would murder her own true love
would kill a little birdlike me.
my love she speaks like silence
without ideals or violence
she doesnt have to say shes faithful
yet shes true like ice like fire
people carry roses
make promises by the hours
my love she laughs like the flowers
valentines cant buy her
in the dime stores and bus stations
people talk of situations
read books repeat quotations
draw conclusions on the wall
some speak of the future
my love she speaks softly
she knows theres no success like failure
and that failures no success at all
the cloak and dagger dangles
madams light the candles
in ceremonies of the horsemen
even the pawn must hold a grudge
statues made of matchsticks
crumble into one another
my love winks she does not bother
she knows too much to argue or to judge
the bridge at midnight trembles
the country doctor rambles
bankers nieces seek perfection
expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
the wind howls like a hammer
the night blows cold and rainy
my love shes like some raven
at my window with a broken wing
im walking through streets that are dead
walking walking with you in my head
my feet are so tired my brain is so wired
and the clouds are weeping
did i hear someone tell a lie
did i hear someones distant cry
i spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
while i was sleeping
im sick of love but im in the thick of it
this kind of love im so sick of it
i see i see lovers in the meadow
i see i see silhouettes in the window
i watch them til theyre gone and they leave me hanging on
to a shadow
im sick of love; i hear the clock tick
this kind of love; im love sick
sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
sometimes i feel like im being plowed under
could you ever be true i think of you
and i wonder
im sick of love; i wish id never met you
im sick of love; im trying to forget you
just dont know what to do
id give anything to be with you
i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
no i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
well i wake in the morning

i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
no i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
well he hands you a nickel

i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
no i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
well he puts his cigar

the national guard stands around his door
ah i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
i aint gonna work for maggies ma no more
no i aint gonna work for maggies ma no more
well she talks to all the servants
about man and god and law

i aint gonna work for maggies ma no more
i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
no i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
well i try my best
to be just like i am
but everybody wants you
to be just like them
they say sing while you slave and i just get bored
i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
instrumental
when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you havent made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
ive known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
id go hungry id go black and blue
id go crawling down the avenue
theres nothing that i wouldnt do
to make you feel my love
the storms are raging on the rollin sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you aint seen nothing like me yet
i could make you happy make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldnt do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
perhaps its the color of the sun cut flat
an covrin the crossroads im standing at
or maybe its the weather or something like that
but mama you been on my mind
i dont mean trouble please dont put me down or get upset
i am not pleadin or sayin i cant forget

as someone who has had you on his mind
i am a man of constant sorrow
i've seen trouble all my days
i'll say goodbye to colorado
where i was born and partly raised
through this open world i'm a-bound to ramble
through ice and snow sleet and rain
im a-bound to ride that mornin' railroad
perhaps i'll die upon that train
your mother says that i'm a stranger
a face you'll never see no more
but here's one promise to ya
i'll see you on god's golden shore
i'm a-goin' back to colorado
the place that i've started from
if i'd knowed how bad you'd treat me
babe i never would have come

big furry paws and he liked to howl
great big furry back and furry hair
ah think ill call it a bear
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals

he saw an animal up on a hill
chewing up so much grass until she was filled
he saw milk comin out but he didnt know how
ah think ill call it a cow
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning long time ago
he saw an animal that liked to snort
horns on his head and they werent too short
it looked like there wasnt nothin that he couldnt pull
ah think ill call it a bull
man gave names to all the animals

crickets are chirpin the water is high
theres a soft cotton dress on the line hangin dry
window wide open african trees
bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
not a word of goodbye not even a note
she gone with the man
in the long black coat
somebody seen him hanging around
at the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
he looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
if he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
somebody said from the bible hed quote
there was dust on the man
in the long black coat
preacher was a talkin theres a sermon he gave
he said every mans conscience is vile and depraved
you cannot depend on it to be your guide
when its you who must keep it satisfied
it aint easy to swallow it sticks in the throat
she gave her heart to the man
in the long black coat
there are no mistakes in life some people say
it is true sometimes you can see it that way
but people don't live or die people just float
she went with the man
in the long black coat
theres smoke on the water its been there since june
tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon
feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
somebody is out there beating a dead horse
she never said nothing there was nothing she wrote
she gone with the man
in the long black coat
the man in me will do nearly any task
and as for compensation theres little he would ask
take a woman like you
to get through to the man in me
storm clouds are raging all around my door
i think to myself i might not take it anymore
take a woman like your kind
to find the man in me
but oh what a wonderful feeling
just to know that you are near
sets my heart a-reeling
from my toes up to my ears
the man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein seen
but thats just because he doesnt want to turn into some machine
took a woman like you
to get through to the man in me
look out your window baby theres a scene youd like to catch
the band is playing dixie a man got his hand outstretched
could be the führer
could be the local priest
you know sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
he got a sweet gift of gab he got a harmonious tongue
he knows every song of love that ever has been sung
good intentions can be evil
both hands can be full of grease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
well first hes in the background then hes in the front
both eyes are looking like theyre on a rabbit hunt
nobody can see through him
no not even the chief of police
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
well he catch you when youre hoping for a glimpse of the sun
catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
he could be standing next to you
the person that youd notice least
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
well he can be fascinating he can be dull
he can ride down niagara falls in the barrels of your skull
i can smell something cooking
i can tell theres going to be a feast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
hes a great humanitarian hes a great philanthropist
he knows just where to touch you honey and how you like to be kissed
hell put both his arms around you
you can feel the tender touch of the beast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
well the howling wolf will howl tonight the king snake will crawl
trees thatve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
wanna get married do it now
tomorrow all activity will cease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
somewhere mamas weeping for her blue-eyed boy
shes holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
and hes following a star
the same one them three men followed from the east
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace

come you masters of war
you that build all the guns
you that build the death planes
you that build the big bombs
you that hide behind walls
you that hide behind desks
i just want you to know
i can see through your masks
you that never done nothin
but build to destroy
you play with my world
like its your little toy
you put a gun in my hand
and you hide from my eyes
and you turn and run farther
when the fast bullets fly
like judas of old
you lie and deceive
a world war can be won
you want me to believe
but i see through your eyes
and i see through your brain
like i see through the water
that runs down my drain
you fasten the triggers
for the others to fire
then you set back and watch
when the death count gets higher
you hide in your mansion
as young peoples blood
flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud
youve thrown the worst fear
that can ever be hurled
fear to bring children
into the world
for threatening my baby
unborn and unnamed
you aint worth the blood
that runs in your veins
how much do i know
to talk out of turn
you might say that im young
you might say im unlearned
but theres one thing i know
though im younger than you
even jesus would never
forgive what you do
let me ask you one question
is your money that good
will it buy you forgiveness
do you think that it could
i think you will find
when your death takes its toll
all the money you made
will never buy back your soul
and i hope that you die
and your deathll come soon
i will follow your casket
in the pale afternoon
and ill watch while youre lowered
down to your deathbed
and ill stand oer your grave
til im sure that youre dead
maybe someday youll be satisfied
when youve lost everything youll have nothing left to hide
when youre through running over things like youre walking cross the tracks
maybe youll beg me to take you back
maybe someday youll find out everybodys somebodys fool
maybe then youll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
maybe someday when youre by yourself alone
youll know the love that i had for you was never my own
maybe someday youll have nowhere to turn
youll look back and wonder bout the bridges you have burned
youll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
and youll see you look much better with me than you do with him
through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
thirty pieces of silver no money down
maybe someday you will understand
that something for nothing is everybodys plan
maybe someday youll remember what you felt
when there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
when both of us baby were going through some sort of a test
neither one of us could do what we do best
i should have known better baby i should have called your bluff
i guess i was too off the handle not sentimental enough
maybe someday youll believe me when i say
that i wanted you baby in every kind of way
maybe someday youll hear a voice from on high
sayin for whose sake did you live for whose sake did you die
forgive me baby for what i didnt do
for not breakin down no bedroom door to get at you
always was a sucker for the right cross
never wanted to go home til the last cent was lost
maybe someday you will look back and see
that i made it so easy for you to follow me
maybe someday therell be nothing to tell
im just as happy as you baby i just cant say it so well
never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
theres no excuse for you to say that we dont think alike
you said you were goin to frisco stay a couple of months
i always like san francisco i was there for a party once
maybe someday youll see that its true
there was no greater love than what i had for you
everything went from bad to worse money never changed a thing
death kept followin trackin us down at least i heard your bluebird sing
now somebodys got to show their hand time is an enemy
i know youre long gone i guess it must be up to me
if id thought about it i never wouldve done it i guess i wouldve let it slide
if id lived my life by what others were thinkin the heart inside me wouldve died
i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
someone had to reach for the risin star i guess it was up to me
oh the union central is pullin out and the orchids are in bloom
ive only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
in fourteen months ive only smiled once and i didnt do it consciously
somebodys got to find your trail i guess it must be up to me
it was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
id just about convinced myself that nothin had changed that much
the old rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
somebody had to unlock your heart he said it was up to me
well i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers club
i wouldve followed you in the door but i didnt have a ticket stub
so i waited all night til the break of day hopin one of us could get free
when the dawn came over the river bridge i knew it was up to me
oh the only decent thing i did when i worked as a postal clerk
was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where i used to work
was i a fool or not to try to protect your identity
you looked a little burned out my friend i thought it might be up to me
well i met somebody face to face and i had to remove my hat
shes everything i need and love but i cant be swayed by that
it frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be
but she aint a-gonna make me move i guess it must be up to me
we heard the sermon on the mount and i knew it was too complex
it didnt amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
when you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
somebodys got to tell the tale i guess it must be up to me
well dupree came in pimpin tonight to the thunderbird café
crystal wanted to talk to him i had to look the other way
well i just cant rest without you love i need your company
but you aint a-gonna cross the line i guess it must be up to me
theres a note left in the bottle you can give it to estelle
shes the one you been wondrin about but theres really nothin much to tell
we both heard voices for a while now the rest is history
somebodys got to cry some tears i guess it must be up to me
so go on boys and play your hands life is a pantomime
the ringleaders from the county seat say you dont have all that much time
and the girl with me behind the shades she aint my property
one of us has got to hit the road i guess it must be up to me
and if we never meet again baby remember me
how my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
and the harmonica around my neck i blew it for you free
no one else could play that tune you know it was up to me
meet me in the morning 56th and wabasha
meet me in the morning 56th and wabasha
honey we could be in kansas
by time the snow begins to thaw
they say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
they say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
but you wouldnt know it by me
every days been darkness since you been gone

every step of the way we walk the line
your days are numbered so are mine
time is pilin up we struggle and we scrape
were all boxed in nowhere to escape
citys just a jungle; more games to play
trapped in the heart of it tryin' to get away
i was raised in the country i been workin in the town
i been in trouble ever since i set my suitcase down
got nothin' for you i had nothin' before
dont even have anything for myself anymore
sky full of fire pain pourin down
nothing you can sell me ill see you around
all my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
well the devils in the alley mules in the stall
say anything you wanna i have heard it all
i was thinkin 'bout the things that rosie said
i was dreaming i was sleepin' in rosies bed
walkin' through the leaves falling from the trees
feelin' like a stranger nobody sees
so many things that we never will undo
i know youre sorry im sorry too
some people will offer you their hand and some wont
last night i knew you tonight i dont
i need somethin strong to distract my mind
im gonna look at you til my eyes go blind
well i got here followin' the southern star
i crossed that river just to be where you are
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
well my ships been split to splinters and its sinkin' fast
im drownin in the poison got no future got no past
but my heart is not weary its light and its free
ive got nothin but affection for all those whove sailed with me
everybody movin if they aint already there
everybody got to move somewhere
stick with me baby stick with me anyhow
things should start to get interestin' right about now
my clothes are wet tight on my skin
not as tight as the corner that i painted myself in
i know that fortune is waitin to be kind
so give me your hand and say youll be mine
well the emptiness is endless cold as the clay
you can always come back but you cant come back all the way
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
i got mixed up confusion
man its a-killin me
well theres too many people
and theyre all too hard to please
well my hats in my hand
babe im walkin down the line
an im lookin for a woman
whose heads mixed up like mine
well my heads full of questions
my tempratures risin fast
well im lookin for some answers
but i dont know who to ask
but im walkin and wonderin
and my poor feet dont ever stop
seein my reflection
im hung over hung down hung up!
the seasons they are turnin and my sad heart is yearnin
to hear again the songbirds sweet melodious tone
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the dusky light the day is losing orchids poppies black-eyed susan
the earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the air is thick and heavy all along the levy
where the geese into the countryside have flown
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
well im preachin peace and harmony
the blessings of tranquility
yet i know when the time is right to strike
ill take you cross the river dear
youve no need to linger here
i know the kinds of things you like
the clouds are turnin crimson–the leaves fall from the limbs an
the branches cast their shadows over stone
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the boulevards of cypress trees the masquerades of birds and bees
the petals pink and white the wind has blown
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the trailing moss and mystic glow
purple blossoms soft as snow
my tears keep flowing to the sea
doctor lawyer indian chief
it takes a thief to catch a thief
for whom does the bell toll for love it tolls for you and me
my pulse is runnin through my palm–the sharp hills are rising from
the yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone
i've been a moonshiner
for seventeen long years
i've spent all my money
on whiskey and beer
i go to some hollow
and sit at my still
and if whiskey dont kill me
then i dont know what will
i go to some bar room
and drink with my friends
where the women cant follow
and see what i spend
god bless them pretty women
i wish they was mine
their breath is as sweet
the dew on the vine
let me eat when i am hungry
let me drink when i am dry
a dollar when i am hard up
religion when i die
the whole world's a bottle
and life's but a dram
when the bottle gets empty
it sure ain't worth a damn.
you say you love me
and youre thinkin of me
but you know you could be wrong
you say you told me
that you wanna hold me
but you know youre not that strong
i just cant do what i done before
i just cant beg you anymore
im gonna let you pass
and ill go last
then time will tell just who fell
and whos been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine
you say you disturb me
and you dont deserve me
but you know sometimes you lie
you say youre shakin
and youre always achin
but you know how hard you try
sometimes it gets so hard to care
it cant be this way evrywhere
and im gonna let you pass
yes and ill go last
then time will tell just who fell
and whos been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine
the judge he holds a grudge
hes gonna call on you
but hes badly built
and he walks on stilts
watch out he dont fall on you
you say youre sorry
for tellin stories
that you know i believe are true
you say ya got some
other kinda lover
and yes i believe you do
you say my kisses are not like his
but this time im not gonna tell you why that is
im just gonna let you pass
yes and ill go last
then time will tell who fell
and whos been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine
most of the time
im clear focused all around
most of the time
i can keep both feet on the ground
i can follow the path i can read the signs
stay right with it when the road unwinds
i can handle whatever i stumble upon
i dont even notice shes gone
most of the time
most of the time
its well understood
most of the time
i wouldnt change it if i could
i can make it all match up i can hold my own
i can deal with the situation right down to the bone
i can survive i can endure
and i dont even think about her
most of the time
most of the time
my head is on straight
most of the time
im strong enough not to hate
i dont build up illusion til it makes me sick
i aint afraid of confusion no matter how thick
i can smile in the face of mankind
dont even remember what her lips felt like on mine
most of the time
most of the time
she aint even in my mind
i wouldnt know her if i saw her
shes that far behind
most of the time
i cant even be sure
if she was ever with me
or if i was with her
most of the time
im halfway content
most of the time
i know exactly where it went
i dont cheat on myself i dont run and hide
hide from the feelings that are buried inside
i dont compromise and i dont pretend
i dont even care if i ever see her again
most of the time
i pounded on a farmhouse
lookin for a place to stay
i was mighty mighty tired
i had come a long long way
i said hey hey in there
is there anybody home
i was standin on the steps
feelin most alone
well out comes a farmer
he must have thought that i was nuts
he immediately looked at me
and stuck a gun into my guts
i fell down
to my bended knees
saying i dig farmers
dont shoot me please!
he cocked his rifle
and began to shout
youre that travelin salesman
that i have heard about
i said no! no! no!
im a doctor and its true
im a clean-cut kid
and i been to college too
then in comes his daughter
whose name was rita
she looked like she stepped out of
la dolce vita
i immediately tried to cool it
with her dad
and told him what a
nice pretty farm he had
he said what do doctors
know about farms pray tell
i said i was born
at the bottom of a wishing well
well by the dirt neath my nails
i guess he knew i wouldnt lie
i guess youre tired
he said kinda sly
i said yes ten thousand miles
today i drove
he said i got a bed for you
underneath the stove
just one condition
and you go to sleep right now
that you dont touch my daughter
and in the morning milk the cow
i was sleepin like a rat
when i heard something jerkin
there stood rita
lookin just like tony perkins
she said would you like to take a shower
ill show you up to the door
i said oh no! no!
ive been through this before
i knew i had to split
but i didnt know how
when she said
would you like to take that shower now
well i couldnt leave
unless the old man chased me out
cause id already promised
that id milk his cows
i had to say something
to strike him very weird
so i yelled out
i like fidel castro and his beard
rita looked offended
but she got out of the way
as he came charging down the stairs
sayin whats that i heard you say
i said i like fidel castro
i think you heard me right
and ducked as he swung
at me with all his might
rita mumbled something
bout her mother on the hill
as his fist hit the icebox
he said hes going to kill me
if i dont get out the door
in two seconds flat
you unpatriotic
rotten doctor commie rat
well he threw a readers digest
at my head and i did run
i did a somersault
as i seen him get his gun
and crashed through the window
at a hundred miles an hour
and landed fully blast
in his garden flowers
rita said come back!
as he started to load
the sun was comin up
and i was runnin down the road
well i dont figure ill be back
there for a spell
even though rita moved away
and got a job in a motel
he still waits for me
constant on the sly
he wants to turn me in
to the f.b.i.
me i romp and stomp
thankful as i romp
without freedom of speech
i might be in the swamp
i like to spend some time in mozambique
the sunny sky is aqua blue
and all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
its very nice to stay a week or two
theres lot of pretty girls in mozambique
and plenty time for good romance
and everybody likes to stop and speak
to give the special one you seek a chance
or maybe say hello with just a glance
lying next to her by the ocean
reaching out and touching her hand
whispering your secret emotion
magic in a magical land
and when its time for leaving mozambique
to say goodbye to sand and sea
you turn around to take a final peek
and you see why its so unique to be
among the lovely people living free
upon the beach of sunny mozambique
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
im not sleepy and there is no place im going to
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
though i know that evenins empire has returned into sand
vanished from my hand
left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
my weariness amazes me im branded on my feet
i have no one to meet
and the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
im not sleepy and there is no place im going to
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin ship
my senses have been stripped my hands cant feel to grip
my toes too numb to step
wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin
im ready to go anywhere im ready for to fade
into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way
i promise to go under it
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
im not sleepy and there is no place im going to
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
though you might hear laughin spinnin swingin madly across the sun
its not aimed at anyone its just escapin on the run
and but for the sky there are no fences facin
and if you hear vague traces of skippin reels of rhyme
to your tambourine in time its just a ragged clown behind
i wouldnt pay it any mind
its just a shadow youre seein that hes chasing
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
im not sleepy and there is no place im going to
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
then take me disappearin through the smoke rings of my mind
down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves
the haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands
with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
let me forget about today until tomorrow
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
im not sleepy and there is no place im going to
hey! mr. tambourine man play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning ill come followin you
crimson flames tied through my ears
rollin high and mighty traps
pounced with fire on flaming roads
using ideas as my maps
well meet on edges soon said i
proud neath heated brow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now
half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
rip down all hate i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull. i dreamed
romantic facts of musketeers
foundationed deep somehow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now
girls faces formed the forward path
from phony jealousy
to memorizing politics
of ancient history
flung down by corpse evangelists
unthought of though somehow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now
a self-ordained professors tongue
too serious to fool
spouted out that liberty
is just equality in school
equality i spoke the word
as if a wedding vow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now
in a soldiers stance i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not that id become my enemy
in the instant that i preach
my pathway led by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now
yes my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect
good and bad i define these terms
quite clear no doubt somehow
ah but i was so much older then
im younger than that now

well i didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
i just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
there ain't no way you can put me down
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town
well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
i can't think of any just now but i know they exist
i'm sitting in the sun 'til my skin turns brown
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town
home town home town
she can make you steal make you rob
give you the hives make you lose your job
make things bad she can make things worse
she got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse
one of these days i'll end up on the run
i'm pretty sure she'll make me kill someone
i'm going inside roll the shutters down
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town
well there's plenty to remember plenty to forget
i still can remember the day we met
i lost my reason long ago
my love for her is all i know
state gone broke the county's dry
don't be looking at me with that evil eye
keep on walking don't be hanging around
i'm telling you again that hell's my wife's home town
home town home town
instrumental
its been raining in the trenches all day long dripping down to my clothes
my patience is wearing thin got a fire inside my nose
searching for the truth the way god designed it
the truth is i might drown before i find it
well i need a woman yes i do
need a woman yes i do
someone who can see me as i am
somebody who just dont give a damn
and i want you to be that woman every night
be that woman
ive had my eyes on you baby for about five long years
you probably dont know me at all but i have seen your laughter and tears
now you dont frighten me my heart is jumping
and you look like it wouldnt hurt you none to have a man
who could give ya something
well i need a woman oh dont i
need a woman bring it home safe at last
seen you turn the corner seen your boot heels spark
seen you in the daylight and watched you in the dark
and i want you to be that woman all right
be that woman every night
well if you believe in something long enough you just naturally
come to think its true
there aint no wall you cant cross over aint no fire you cant walk through
well believing is all right just dont let the wrong people know what its all about
they might put the evil eye on you use their hidden powers to try to turn you out
well i need a woman just to be my queen
need a woman know what i mean
well the neighborhood bully hes just one man
his enemies say hes on their land
they got him outnumbered about a million to one
he got no place to escape to no place to run
hes the neighborhood bully
the neighborhood bully just lives to survive
hes criticized and condemned for being alive
hes not supposed to fight back hes supposed to have thick skin
hes supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
hes the neighborhood bully
the neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
hes wandered the earth an exiled man
seen his family scattered his people hounded and torn
hes always on trial for just being born
hes the neighborhood bully
well he knocked out a lynch mob he was criticized
old women condemned him said he should apologize.
then he destroyed a bomb factory nobody was glad
the bombs were meant for him. he was supposed to feel bad
hes the neighborhood bully
well the chances are against it and the odds are slim
that hell live by the rules that the world makes for him
cause theres a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
and a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
hes the neighborhood bully
he got no allies to really speak of
what he gets he must pay for he dont get it out of love
he buys obsolete weapons and he wont be denied
but no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
hes the neighborhood bully
well hes surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
they pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
now they wouldnt hurt a fly. to hurt one they would weep
they lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
hes the neighborhood bully
every empire thats enslaved him is gone
egypt and rome even the great babylon
hes made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
in bed with nobody under no ones command
hes the neighborhood bully
now his holiest books have been trampled upon
no contract he signed was worth what it was written on
he took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
hes the neighborhood bully
whats anybody indebted to him for
nothin they say. he just likes to cause war
pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
they wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
hes the neighborhood bully
what has he done to wear so many scars
does he change the course of rivers does he pollute the moon and stars
neighborhood bully standing on the hill
running out the clock time standing still
neighborhood bully
lost john sitting on a railroad track
something's out of wack
blues this morning falling down like hail
gonna leave a greasy trail
gonna travel the world is what i'm gonna do
then come back and see you
all i ever do is struggle and strive
if i don't do anybody any harm i might make it back home alive
i'm the oldest son of a crazy man
i'm in a cowboy band
got a pile of sins to pay for and i ain't got time to hide
i'd walk through a blazing fire baby if i knew you was on the other side
oh i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here that's left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes
the world of research has gone berserk
too much paperwork
albert's in the graveyard frankie's raising hell
i'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell
i'm going where the southern crosses the yellow dog
get away from these demagogues
and these bad luck women stick like glue
it's either one or the other or neither of the two
she says look out daddy don't want you to tear your pants.
you can get wrecked in this dance.
they say whiskey will kill ya but i don't think it will
i'm riding with you to the top of the hill
oh i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here that's left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes
don't know why my baby never looked so good before
i don't have to wonder no more
she been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
i can't eat all that stuff in a single bite
the judge is coming in everybody rise
lift up your eyes
you can do what you please you don't need my advice
before you call me any dirty names you better think twice
getting light outside the temperature dropped
i think the rain has stopped
i'm going to make you come to grips with fate
when i'm through with you you'll learn to keep your business straight
oh i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here that's left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes
the bright spark of the steady lights
has dimmed my sights
when you're around all my grief gives 'way
a lifetime with you is like some heavenly day
everything i've ever known to be right has proven wrong
i'll be drifting along
the woman i'm lovin' she rules my heart
no knife could ever cut our love apart
today i'll stand in faith and raise
the voice of praise
the sun is strong i'm standing in the light
i wish to god that it were night
oh i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here that's left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes
now youre here beside me baby
youre a living dream
and every time you get this close
it makes me want to scream
you touched me and you knew
that i was warm for you and then
i aint never gonna be the same again
sorry if i hurt you baby
sorry if i did
sorry if i touched the place
where your secrets are hid
but you meant more than everything
and i could not pretend
i aint never gonna be the same again
you give me something to think about baby
every time i see ya
dont worry baby i dont mind leaving
id just like it to be my idea
you taught me how to love you baby
you taught me oh so well
now i cant go back to what was baby
i cant unring the bell
you took my reality
and cast it to the wind
and i aint never gonna be the same again
twilight on the frozen lake
north wind about to break
on footprints in the snow
silence down below
youre beautiful beyond words
youre beautiful to me
you can make me cry
never say goodbye
time is all i have to give
you can have it if you choose
with me you can live
never say goodbye
my dreams are made of iron and steel
with a big bouquet
of roses hanging down
from the heavens to the ground
the crashing waves roll over me
as i stand upon the sand
wait for you to come
and grab hold of my hand
oh baby baby baby blue
youll change your last name too
youve turned your hair to brown
love to see it hangin down
cant you hear that rooster crowin
rabbit runnin down across the road
underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
so happy just to see you smile
underneath the sky of blue
on this new morning new morning
on this new morning with you
cant you hear that motor turnin
automobile comin into style
comin down the road for a country mile or two
so happy just to see you smile
underneath the sky of blue
on this new morning new morning
on this new morning with you
the night passed away so quickly
it always does when youre with me
cant you feel that sun a-shinin
groundhog runnin by the country stream
this must be the day that all of my dreams come true
so happy just to be alive
underneath the sky of blue
on this new morning new morning
on this new morning with you
so happy just to be alive
underneath the sky of blue
on this new morning new morning
on this new morning with you
new morning . . .
once i had a pony her name was lucifer
i had a pony her name was lucifer
she broke her leg and she needed shooting
i swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her
sometimes i wonder whats going on in the mind of miss x
sometimes i wonder whats going on in the mind of miss x
you know she got such a sweet disposition
i never know what the poor girls gonna do to me next
i got a new pony she knows how to fox-trot lope and pace
well i got a new pony she knows how to fox-trot lope and pace
she got great big hind legs
and long black shaggy hair above her face
well now it was early in the mornin i seen your shadow in the door
it was early in the mornin i seen your shadow in the door
now i dont have to ask nobody
i know what you come here for
they say youre usin voodoo your feet walk by themselves

come over here pony i i wanna climb up one time on you
well youre so bad and nasty
but i love you yes i do
on a night like this
so glad you came around
hold on to me so tight
and heat up some coffee grounds
we got much to talk about
and much to reminisce
it sure is right
on a night like this
on a night like this
so glad youve come to stay
hold on to me pretty miss
say youll never go away to stray
run your fingers down my spine
bring me a touch of bliss
it sure feels right
on a night like this
on a night like this
i cant get any sleep
the air is so cold outside
and the snows so deep
build a fire throw on logs
and listen to it hiss
and let it burn burn burn burn
on a night like this
put your body next to mine
and keep me company
there is plenty a-room for all
so please dont elbow me
let the four winds blow
around this old cabin door
if im not too far off
i think we did this once before
theres more frost on the window glass
with each new tender kiss
but it sure feels right
on a night like this
no more auction block for me
no more no more
no more auction block for me
many thousands gone
no more driver's lash for me
no more no more
no more driver's lash for me
many thousands gone
no more whip lash for me
no more no more
no more pint of salt for me
many thousands gone
no more auction block for me
no more no more
no more auction block for me
many thousands gone
in death you face life with a child and a wife
who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
youre a soldier of mercy youre cold and you curse
he who cannot be trusted must fall
loneliness tenderness high society notoriety
you fight for the throne and you travel alone
unknown as you slowly sink
and theres no time to think
in the federal city you been blown and shown pity
in secret for pieces of change
the empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
and it makes you feel violent and strange
memory ecstasy tyranny hypocrisy
betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
in the valley of the missing link
and you have no time to think
judges will haunt you the country priestess will want you
her worst is better than best
ive seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
and i feel so depressed
china doll alcohol duality mortality
mercury rules you and destiny fools you
like the plague with a dangerous wink
and theres no time to think
your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
where the lion lies down with the lamb
id have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
but thats just the way that i am
paradise sacrifice mortality reality
but the magician is quicker and his game
is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
and theres no time to think
anger and jealousys all that he sells us
hes content when youre under his thumb
madmen oppose him but your kindness throws him
to survive it you play deaf and dumb
equality liberty humility simplicity
you glance through the mirror and theres eyes staring clear
at the back of your head as you drink
and theres no time to think
warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
will offer their heads for a prayer
you cant find no salvation you have no expectations
anytime anyplace anywhere
mercury gravity nobility humility
you know you cant keep her and the water gets deeper
that is leading you onto the brink
but theres no time to think
youve murdered your vanity buried your sanity
for pleasure you must now resist
lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
theyre not even sure you exist
socialism hypnotism patriotism materialism
fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
and the sound of the keys as they clink
but theres no time to think
the bridge that you travel on goes to the babylon girl
with the rose in her hair
starlight in the east and youre finally released
youre stranded but with nothing to share
loyalty unity epitome rigidity
you turn around for one real last glimpse of camille
neath the moon shinin bloody and pink
and theres no time to think
bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
but no you will not be deceived
stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
you can give but you cannot receive
no time to choose when the truth must die
no time to lose or say goodbye
no time to prepare for the victim thats there
no time to suffer or blink
and no time to think
theres nothing round here i believe in
cept you yeah you
and theres nothing to me thats sacred
cept you yeah you
youre the one that reaches me
youre the one that i admire
every time we meet together
my soul feels like its on fire
nothing matters to me
and theres nothing i desire
cept you yeah you
nothing round here i care to try for
cept you yeah you
got nothing left to live or die for
cept you yeah you
theres a hymn i used to hear
in the churches all the time
make me feel so good inside
so peaceful so sublime
and theres nothing to remind me of that
old familiar chime
cept you uh huh you
used to play in the cemetery
dance and sing and run when i was a child
never seemed strange
but now i just pass mournfully by
that place where the bones of life are piled
i know somethin has changed
im a stranger here and no one sees me
cept you yeah you
nothing much matters or seems to please me
cept you yeah you
nothing hypnotizes me
or holds me in a spell
everything runs by me
just like water from a well
everybody wants my attention
everybodys got something to sell
cept you yeah you

shadows are falling and ive been here all day
its too hot to sleep time is running away
feel like my soul has turned into steel
ive still got the scars that the sun didnt heal
theres not even room enough to be anywhere
its not dark yet but its getting there
well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
behind every beautiful thing theres been some kind of pain
she wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
she put down in writing what was in her mind
i just dont see why i should even care
its not dark yet but its getting there
well ive been to london and ive been to gay paree
ive followed the river and i got to the sea
ive been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
i aint looking for nothing in anyones eyes
sometimes my burden seems more than i can bear
its not dark yet but its getting there
i was born here and ill die here against my will
i know it looks like im moving but im standing still
every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb

oh sister when i come to lie in your arms
you should not treat me like a stranger
our father would not like the way that you act
and you must realize the danger
oh sister am i not a brother to you
and one deserving of affection
and is our purpose not the same on this earth
to love and follow his direction
we grew up together
from the cradle to the grave
we died and were reborn
and then mysteriously saved
oh sister when i come to knock on your door
dont turn away youll create sorrow
time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
you may not see me tomorrow
your breath is sweet
your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
your back is straight your hair is smooth
on the pillow where you lie
but i dont sense affection
no gratitude or love
your loyalty is not to me
but to the stars above
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee fore i go
to the valley below
your daddy hes an outlaw
and a wanderer by trade
hell teach you how to pick and choose
and how to throw the blade
he oversees his kingdom
so no stranger does intrude
his voice it trembles as he calls out
for another plate of food
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee fore i go
to the valley below
your sister sees the future
like your mama and yourself
youve never learned to read or write
theres no books upon your shelf
and your pleasure knows no limits
your voice is like a meadowlark
but your heart is like an ocean
mysterious and dark
one more cup of coffee for the road
one more cup of coffee fore i go
to the valley below
one more night the stars are in sight
but tonight im as lonesome as can be
oh the moon is shinin bright
lighting evrything in sight
but tonight no light will shine on me
oh its shameful and its sad i lost the only pal i had
i just could not be what she wanted me to be
i will turn my head up high
to that dark and rolling sky
for tonight no light will shine on me
i was so mistaken when i thought that shed be true
i had no idea what a woman in love would do!
one more night i will wait for the light
while the wind blows high above the tree
oh i miss my darling so
i didnt mean to see her go
but tonight no light will shine on me
one more night the moon is shinin bright
and the wind blows high above the tree
oh i miss that woman so
i didnt mean to see her go
but tonight no light will shine on me
slippin and slidin like a weasel on the run
im lookin good to see you yeah and we can have some fun

down the street the dogs are barkin
and the day is a-gettin dark
as the night comes in a-fallin
the dogsll lose their bark
an the silent night will shatter
from the sounds inside my mind
for im one too many mornings
and a thousand miles behind
from the crossroads of my doorstep
my eyes they start to fade
as i turn my head back to the room
where my love and i have laid
an i gaze back to the street
the sidewalk and the sign
and im one too many mornings
an a thousand miles behind
its a restless hungry feeling
that dont mean no one no good
when evrything im a-sayin
you can say it just as good.
youre right from your side
im right from mine
were both just one too many mornings
an a thousand miles behind
i didnt mean to treat you so bad
you shouldnt take it so personal
i didnt mean to make you so sad
you just happened to be there thats all
when i saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
i thought that it was well understood
that youd be comin back in a little while
i didnt know that you were sayin goodbye for good
but sooner or later one of us must know
you just did what youre supposed to do
sooner or later one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you
i couldnt see what you could show me
your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
i couldnt see how you could know me
but you said you knew me and i believed you did
when you whispered in my ear
and asked me if i was leavin with you or her
i didnt realize just what i did hear
i didnt realize how young you were
but sooner or later one of us must know
you just did what youre supposed to do
sooner or later one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you
i couldnt see when it started snowin
your voice was all that i heard
i couldnt see where we were goin
but you said you knew an i took your word
and then you told me later as i apologized
that you were just kiddin me you werent really from the farm
an i told you as you clawed out my eyes
that i never really meant to do you any harm
but sooner or later one of us must know
you just did what youre supposed to do
sooner or later one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you
as i was out walking on a corner one day
i spied an old hobo in a doorway he lay
his face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
and i guess hed been there for the whole night or more
only a hobo but one more is gone
leavin nobody to sing his sad song
leavin nobody to carry him home
only a hobo but one more is gone
a blanket of newspaper covered his head
as the curb was his pillow the street was his bed
one look at his face showed the hard road hed come
and a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed
only a hobo but one more is gone
leavin nobody to sing his sad song
leavin nobody to carry him home
only a hobo but one more is gone
does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
to look up on the world from a hole in the ground
to wait for your future like a horse thats gone lame
to lie in the gutter and die with no name
only a hobo but one more is gone
leavin nobody to sing his sad song
leavin nobody to carry him home
only a hobo but one more is gone
a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers blood
a finger fired the trigger to his name
a handle hid out in the dark
a hand set the spark
two eyes took the aim
behind a mans brain
but he cant be blamed
hes only a pawn in their game
a south politician preaches to the poor white man
you got more than the blacks dont complain.
youre better than them you been born with white skin they explain.
and the negros name
is used it is plain
for the politicians gain
as he rises to fame
and the poor white remains
on the caboose of the train
but it aint him to blame
hes only a pawn in their game
the deputy sheriffs the soldiers the governors get paid
and the marshals and cops get the same
but the poor white mans used in the hands of them all like a tool
hes taught in his school
from the start by the rule
that the laws are with him
to protect his white skin
to keep up his hate
so he never thinks straight
bout the shape that hes in
but it aint him to blame
hes only a pawn in their game
from the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks
and the hoofbeats pound in his brain
and hes taught how to walk in a pack
shoot in the back
with his fist in a clinch
to hang and to lynch
to hide neath the hood
to kill with no pain
like a dog on a chain
he aint got no name
but it aint him to blame
hes only a pawn in their game.
today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught
they lowered him down as a king
but when the shadowy sun sets on the one
that fired the gun
hell see by his grave
on the stone that remains
carved next to his name
his epitaph plain:
only a pawn in their game
now theres a certain thing
that i learned from jim
that hed always make sure id understand
and that is that theres a certain way

ive heard it said before

but theres a clearer road a-waitin
with the cinders on the side
trails of troubles

the hummin of its wheels
my eyes they saw a better day
as i looked across the fields
trails of troubles
roads of battles
paths of victory
we shall walk
the trail is dusty
the road it might be rough
but the good road is a-waitin
and boys it aint far off
trails of troubles

the game is the same—its just on a different level
poor boy—dressed in black

poor boy in a red hot town
out beyond the twinklin stars
ridin first-class trains—making the rounds
tryin to keep from fallin between the cars

we live in a political world
love dont have any place
were living in times where men commit crimes
and crime dont have a face
we live in a political world
icicles hanging down
wedding bells ring and angels sing
clouds cover up the ground
we live in a political world
wisdom is thrown into jail
it rots in a cell is misguided as hell
leaving no one to pick up a trail
we live in a political world
where mercy walks the plank
life is in mirrors death disappears
up the steps into the nearest bank
we live in a political world
where courage is a thing of the past
houses are haunted children are unwanted
the next day could be your last
we live in a political world
the one we can see and can feel
but theres no one to check its all a stacked deck
we all know for sure that its real
we live in a political world
in the cities of lonesome fear
little by little you turn in the middle
but youre never sure why youre here
we live in a political world
under the microscope
you can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
you always got more than enough rope
we live in a political world
turning and a-thrashing about
as soon as youre awake youre trained to take
what looks like the easy way out
we live in a political world
where peace is not welcome at all
its turned away from the door to wander some more
or put up against the wall
we live in a political world
everything is hers or his
climb into the frame and shout gods name
but youre never sure what it is
mm tell mama

you got a lotta nerve
to say you are my friend
when i was down
you just stood there grinning
you got a lotta nerve
to say you got a helping hand to lend
you just want to be on
the side thats winning
you say i let you down
you know its not like that
if youre so hurt
why then dont you show it
you say you lost your faith
but thats not where its at
you had no faith to lose
and you know it
i know the reason
that you talk behind my back
i used to be among the crowd
youre in with
do you take me for such a fool
to think id make contact
with the one who tries to hide
what he dont know to begin with
you see me on the street
you always act surprised
you say how are you good luck
but you dont mean it
when you know as well as me
youd rather see me paralyzed
why dont you just come out once
and scream it
no i do not feel that good
when i see the heartbreaks you embrace
if i was a master thief
perhaps id rob them
and now i know youre dissatisfied
with your position and your place
dont you understand
its not my problem
i wish that for just one time
you could stand inside my shoes
and just for that one moment
i could be you
yes i wish that for just one time
you could stand inside my shoes
youd know what a drag it is
to see you
precious angel under the sun
how was i to know youd be the one
to show me i was blinded to show me i was gone
how weak was the foundation i was standing upon
now theres spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there aint no neutral ground
the enemy is subtle how be it we are so deceived
when the truths in our hearts and we still dont believe
shine your light shine your light on me
shine your light shine your light on me
shine your light shine your light on me
ya know i just couldnt make it by myself
im a little too blind to see
my so-called friends have fallen under a spell
they look me squarely in the eye and they say all is well
can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
when men will beg god to kill them and they wont be able to die

ramona
come closer
shut softly your watery eyes
the pangs of your sadness
shall pass as your senses will rise
the flowers of the city
though breathlike
get deathlike at times
and theres no use in tryin
t deal with the dyin
though i cannot explain that in lines
your cracked country lips
i still wish to kiss
as to be under the strength of your skin
your magnetic movements
still capture the minutes im in
but it grieves my heart love
to see you tryin to be a part of
a world that just dont exist
its all just a dream babe
a vacuum a scheme babe
that sucks you into feelin like this
i can see that your head
has been twisted and fed
by worthless foam from the mouth
i can tell you are torn
between stayin and returnin
on back to the south
youve been fooled into thinking
that the finishin end is at hand
yet theres no one to beat you
no one t defeat you
cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
ive heard you say many times
that youre better n no one
and no one is better n you
if you really believe that
you know you got
nothing to win and nothing to lose
from fixtures and forces and friends
your sorrow does stem
that hype you and type you
making you feel
that you must be exactly like them
id forever talk to you
but soon my words
they would turn into a meaningless ring
for deep in my heart
i know there is no help i can bring
everything passes
everything changes
just do what you think you should do
and someday maybe
who knows baby
ill come and be cryin to you
oh all the money that in my whole life i did spend
be it mine right or wrongfully
i let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
to tie up the time most forcefully
but the bottles are done
weve killed each one
and the tables full and overflowed
and the corner sign
says its closing time
so ill bid farewell and be down the road
oh evry girl that ever ive touched
i did not do it harmfully
and evry girl that ever ive hurt
i did not do it knowinly
but to remain as friends
and make amends
you need the time and stay behind
and since my feet are now fast
and point away from the past
ill bid farewell and be down the line
oh evry foe that ever i faced
the cause was there before we came
and evry cause that ever i fought
i fought it full without regret or shame
but the dark does die
as the curtain is drawn and somebodys eyes
must meet the dawn
and if i see the day
id only have to stay
so ill bid farewell in the night and be gone
oh evry thought thats strung a knot in my mind
i might go insane if it couldnt be sprung
but its not to stand naked under unknowin eyes
its for myself and my friends my stories are sung
but the time aint tall yet on time you depend
and no word is possessed by no special friend
and though the line is cut
it aint quite the end
ill just bid farewell till we meet again
oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
to disgrace distract and bother me
and the dirt of gossip blows into my face
and the dust of rumors covers me
but if the arrow is straight
and the point is slick
it can pierce through dust no matter how thick
so ill make my stand
and remain as i am
and bid farewell and not give a damn
ring them bells ye heathen
from the city that dreams
ring them bells from the sanctuaries
cross the valleys and streams
for theyre deep and theyre wide
and the worlds on its side
and time is running backwards
and so is the bride
ring them bells st. peter
where the four winds blow
ring them bells with an iron hand
so the people will know
oh its rush hour now
on the wheel and the plow
and the sun is going down
upon the sacred cow
ring them bells sweet martha
for the poor mans son
ring them bells so the world will know
that god is one
oh the shepherd is asleep
where the willows weep
and the mountains are filled
with lost sheep
ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
ring them bells for all of us who are left
ring them bells for the chosen few
who will judge the many when the game is through
ring them bells for the time that flies
for the child that cries
when innocence dies
ring them bells st. catherine
from the top of the room
ring them from the fortress
for the lilies that bloom
oh the lines are long
and the fighting is strong
and theyre breaking down the distance
between right and wrong
instrumental

i rolled and i tumbled i cried the whole night long
i rolled and i tumbled i cried the whole night long

some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains
the landscape is glowin' gleamin' in the golden light of day

well i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well i paid and i paid and my sufferin' heart is always on the line
well i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i ain't nobody's house boy i ain't nobody's well trained maid
i'm flat-out spent this woman been drivin' me to tears
i'm flat-out spent this woman she been drivin' me to tears
this woman so crazy i swear i ain't gonna touch another one for years
well the warm weather is comin' and the buds are on the vine
the warm weather's comin' the buds are on the vine
ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine
i got up this mornin' saw the rising sun return
well i got up this mornin' seen the rising sun return
sooner or later you too shall burn
the night's filled with shadows the years are filled with early doom
the night's filled with shadows the years are filled with early doom
i've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumblin' tombs
let's forgive each other darlin' let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's forgive each other darlin' let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's put our heads together let's put old matters to an end
now i rolled and i tumbled and i cried the whole night long
ah i rolled and i tumbled i cried the whole night long
i woke up this morning i think i must be travelin' wrong
once upon a time you dressed so fine
you threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you
peopled call say beware doll youre bound to fall
you thought they were all kiddin you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hangin out
now you dont talk so loud
now you dont seem so proud
about having to be scrounging for your next meal
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be without a home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone
youve gone to the finest school all right miss lonely
but you know you only used to get juiced in it
and nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
and now you find out youre gonna have to get used to it
you said youd never compromise
with the mystery tramp but now you realize
hes not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and ask him do you want to make a deal
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone
you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
when they all come down and did tricks for you
you never understood that it aint no good
you shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
you used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
aint it hard when you discover that
he really wasnt where its at
after he took from you everything he could steal
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone
princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
theyre drinkin thinkin that they got it made
exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
but youd better lift your diamond ring youd better pawn it babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
go to him now he calls you you cant refuse
when you got nothing you got nothing to lose
youre invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone
hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
dust on my face and my cape

for a few crumbs and a place to hide
but i can get another one
and ill play for magdalena as we ride
no ilores mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango
past the aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
hoofbeats like castanets on stone
at night i dream of bells in the village steeple
then i see the bloody face of ramon
was it me that shot him down in the cantina
was it my hand that held the gun
come let us fly my magdalena
the dogs are barking and whats done is done
no ilores mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango
at the corrida well sit in the shade
and watch the young torero stand alone
well drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
when they rode with villa into torreón
then the padre will recite the prayers of old
in the little church this side of town
i will wear new boots and an earring of gold
youll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown
the way is long but the end is near
already the fiesta has begun
the face of god will appear
with his serpent eyes of obsidian
no ilores mi querida
dio nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango
was that the thunder that i heard
my head is vibrating i feel a sharp pain
come sit by me dont say a word
oh can it be that i am slain
quick magdalena take my gun
look up in the hills that flash of light
aim well my little one
we may not make it through the night
no ilores mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango
with your mercury mouth in the missionary times
and your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
and your silver cross and your voice like chimes
oh who among them do they think could bury you
with your pockets well protected at last
and your streetcar visions which you place on the grass
and your flesh like silk and your face like glass
who among them do they think could carry you
sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad-eyed lady should i wait
with your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
and your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
and your basement clothes and your hollow face
who among them can think he could outguess you
with your silhouette when the sunlight dims
into your eyes where the moonlight swims
and your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
who among them would try to impress you
sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad-eyed lady should i wait
the kings of tyrus with their convict list
are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
and you wouldnt know it would happen like this
but who among them really wants just to kiss you
with your childhood flames on your midnight rug
and your spanish manners and your mothers drugs
and your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
who among them do you think could resist you
sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad-eyed lady should i wait
oh the farmers and the businessmen they all did decide
to show you the dead angels that they used to hide
but why did they pick you to sympathize with their side
oh how could they ever mistake you
they wished youd accepted the blame for the farm
but with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
and with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
how could they ever ever persuade you
sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad-eyed lady should i wait
with your sheet-metal memory of cannery row
and your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
and your gentleness now which you just cant help but show
who among them do you think would employ you
now you stand with your thief youre on his parole
with your holy medallion which your fingertips fold
and your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul
oh who among them do you think could destroy you
sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
my warehouse eyes my arabian drums
should i leave them by your gate
or sad-eyed lady should i wait
i laid on a dune i looked at the sky
when the children were babies and played on the beach
you came up behind me i saw you go by
you were always so close and still within reach

whatever made you want to change your mind

so easy to look at so hard to define

as they follow each other back up the hill

beautiful lady so dear to my heart
how did i meet you i dont know
a messenger sent me in a tropical storm
you were there in the winter moonlight on the snow
and on lily pond lane when the weather was warm
sara oh sara
scorpio sphinx in a calico dress

you must forgive me my unworthiness
now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
and a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
you always responded when i needed your help
you gimme a map and a key to your door
sara oh sara

in a pine box for all eternity
my faith keeps me alive but i still be weeping
for the saving grace thats over me
well the death of life then come the resurrection
wherever i am welcome is where ill be
i put all my confidence in him my sole protection
is the saving grace thats over me
well the devils shining light it can be most blinding
but to search for love that aint no more than vanity
as i look around this world all that im finding
is the saving grace thats over me
the wicked know no peace and you just cant fake it
theres only one road and it leads to calvary
it gets discouraging at times but i know ill make it
by the saving grace thats over me
went out last night to take a little round.
i met my little sadie and i brought her down.
i ran right home and i went to bed
with a forty-four smokeless under my head.
i began to think what a deed i'd done.
i grabbed my hat and i began to run.
i made a god run but i ran too slow;
they overtook me down in jericho
standing on a corner a ringin' my bell
up stepped the sheriff from thomasville.
he said 'young man is you name brown
remember you blowed sadie down.
oh yes sir my name is lee.
i murdered little sadie in the first degree.
first degree and second degree.
if  you've got any papers will you serve them to me
well they took me down town  and they dressed me in black
they put me on a train and they sent me back.
i had no one to go my bail;
they crammed me back into the county jail.
oh yes they did.
the judge and the jury they took their stand.
the judge had the papers in his right hand.
forty-one days forty-one nights;
forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;
oh no!
went out last night to take a little round.
i met little sadie and i blowed her down.
i ran right home and i went to bed
a forty-four smokeless under my head.
well i thought that the rain would cool things down
but it looks like it dont
id like to get you to change your mind
but it looks like you wont
from now on ill be busy
aint goin nowhere fast
im just glad its over
and im seeing the real you at last
well didnt i risk my neck for you
didnt i take chances
didnt i rise above it all for you
the most unfortunate circumstances
well i have had some rotten nights
didnt think that they would pass
im just thankful and grateful
to be seeing the real you at last
im hungry and im irritable
and im tired of this bag of tricks
at one time there was nothing wrong with me
that you could not fix
well i sailed through the storm
strapped to the mast
but the time has come
and im seeing the real you at last
when i met you baby
you didnt show no visible scars
you could ride like annie oakley
you could shoot like belle starr
well i dont mind a reasonable amount of trouble
trouble always comes to pass
but all i care about now
is that im seeing the real you at last
well im gonna quit this baby talk now
i guess i should have known
i got troubles i think maybe you got troubles
i think maybe wed better leave each other alone
whatever you gonna do
please do it fast
im still trying to get used to
seeing the real you at last
señor señor do you know where were headin
lincoln county road or armageddon
seems like i been down this way before
is there any truth in that señor
señor señor do you know where she is hidin
how long are we gonna be ridin
how long must i keep my eyes glued to the door
will there be any comfort there señor
theres a wicked wind still blowin on that upper deck
theres an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
theres a marchin band still playin in that vacant lot
where she held me in her arms one time and said forget me not
señor señor i can see that painted wagon
i can smell the tail of the dragon
cant stand the suspense anymore
can you tell me who to contact here señor
well the last thing i remember before i stripped and kneeled
was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
a gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
said son this aint a dream no more its the real thing
señor señor you know their hearts is as hard as leather
well give me a minute let me get it together
i just gotta pick myself up off the floor
im ready when you are señor
señor señor lets disconnect these cables
overturn these tables
this place dont make sense to me no more
can you tell me what were waiting for señor
i was thinking of a series of dreams
where nothing comes up to the top
everything stays down where its wounded
and comes to a permanent stop
wasnt thinking of anything specific
like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams
nothing too very scientific
just thinking of a series of dreams
thinking of a series of dreams
where the time and the tempo fly
and theres no exit in any direction
cept the one that you cant see with your eyes
wasnt making any great connection
wasnt falling for any intricate scheme
nothing that would pass inspection
just thinking of a series of dreams
dreams where the umbrella is folded
into the path you are hurled
and the cards are no good that youre holding
unless theyre from another world
in one numbers were burning
in another i witnessed a crime
in one i was running and in another
all i seemed to be doing was climb
wasnt looking for any special assistance
not going to any great extremes
id already gone the distance
just thinking of a series of dreams
old reilly stole a stallion
but they caught him and they brought him back
and they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
with an iron chain around his neck
old reillys daughter got a message
that her father was goin to hang
she rode by night and came by morning
with gold and silver in her hand
when the judge he saw reillys daughter
his old eyes deepened in his head
sayin gold will never free your father
the price my dear is you instead
oh im as good as dead cried reilly
its only you that he does crave
and my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
get on your horse and ride away
oh father you will surely die
if i dont take the chance to try
and pay the price and not take your advice
for that reason i will have to stay
the gallows shadows shook the evening
in the night a hound dog bayed
in the night the grounds were groanin
in the night the price was paid
the next mornin she had awoken
to know that the judge had never spoken
she saw that hangin branch a-bendin
she saw her fathers body broken
these be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
that one doctor will not save him
that two healers will not heal him
that three eyes will not see him
that four ears will not hear him
that five walls will not hide him
that six diggers will not bury him
and that seven deaths shall never kill him
seven days seven more days shell be comin
ill be waiting at the station for her to arrive
seven more days all i gotta do is survive
she been gone ever since i been a child
ever since i seen her smile i aint forgotten her eyes
she had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies
i been good i been good while i been waitin
maybe guilty of hesitatin i just been holdin on
seven more days all thatll be gone
theres kissing in the valley
thieving in the alley
fighting every inch of the way
trying to be tender
with somebody i remember
in a night thats always brightern the day
seven days seven more days that are connected

my beautiful comrade from the north
theres kissing in the valley
thieving in the alley

trying to be tender

shes got everything she needs
shes an artist she dont look back
shes got everything she needs
shes an artist she dont look back
she can take the dark out of the nighttime
and paint the daytime black
you will start out standing
proud to steal her anything she sees
you will start out standing
proud to steal her anything she sees
but you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
down upon your knees
she never stumbles
shes got no place to fall
she never stumbles
shes got no place to fall
shes nobodys child
the law cant touch her at all
she wears an egyptian ring
that sparkles before she speaks
she wears an egyptian ring
that sparkles before she speaks
shes a hypnotist collector
you are a walking antique
bow down to her on sunday
salute her when her birthday comes
bow down to her on sunday
salute her when her birthday comes
for halloween give her a trumpet
and for christmas buy her a drum
twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood
when blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
i came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
and if i pass this way again you can rest assured
ill always do my best for her on that i give my word
in a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
everything up to that point had been left unresolved
try imagining a place where its always safe and warm
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
i was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
poisoned in the bushes an blown out on the trail
hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
suddenly i turned around and she was standin there
with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
now theres a wall between us somethin theres been lost
i took too much for granted got my signals crossed
just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
but nothing really matters much its doom alone that counts
and the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
ive heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove
and old men with broken teeth stranded without love
do i understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
in a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
i bargained for salvation an they gave me a lethal dose
i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
well im livin in a foreign country but im bound to cross the line
beauty walks a razors edge someday ill make it mine
if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born
come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm
oh shenandoah i long to hear you

if i ever became what you wanted me to be
did i miss the mark or overstep the line
that only you could see
seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of me
listen to the engine listen to the bell
as the last fire truck from hell
goes rolling by
all good people are praying
its the last temptation the last account
the last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
the last radio is playing
seen a shooting star tonight
slip away
tomorrow will be
another day
guess its too late to say the things to you
that you needed to hear me say
seen a shooting star tonight
slip away

silvio
silver and gold
won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
silvio
i gotta go
find out something only dead men know
honest as the next jade rolling that stone
when i come knocking don't throw me no bone
i'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
if you don't like it you can leave me alone
i can snap my fingers and require the rain
from a clear blue sky and turn it off again
i can stroke your body and relieve your pain
and charm the whistle off an evening train
i give what i got until i got no more
i take what i get until i even the score
you know i love you and furthermore
when it's time to go you got an open door
i can tell you fancy i can tell you plain
you give something up for everything you gain
since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
pay for your ticket and don't complain
one of these days and it won't be long
going down in the valley and sing my song
i will sing it loud and sing it strong
let the echo decide if i was right or wrong
silvio
silver and gold
won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
silvio
i gotta go
find out something only dead men know
they sat together in the park
as the evening sky grew dark
she looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
twas then he felt alone and wished that hed gone straight
and watched out for a simple twist of fate
they walked along by the old canal
a little confused i remember well
and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin bright
he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
moving with a simple twist of fate
a saxophone someplace far off played
as she was walkin by the arcade
as the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin up
she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
and forgot about a simple twist of fate
he woke up the room was bare
he didnt see her anywhere
he told himself he didnt care pushed the window open wide
felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
brought on by a simple twist of fate
he hears the ticking of the clocks
and walks along with a parrot that talks
hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
maybe shell pick him out again how long must he wait
once more for a simple twist of fate
people tell me its a sin
to know and feel too much within
i still believe she was my twin but i lost the ring
she was born in spring but i was born too late
blame it on a simple twist of fate
1.was in the summer
one early fall
just tryin' to find my
little all and all

all their earthly principles theyre gonna have to abandon
theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
i had a woman down in alabama
she was a backwoods girl but she sure was realistic
she said boy without a doubt

you could die down here be just another accident statistic
theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
all that foreign oil controlling american soil
look around you its just bound to make you embarrassed
sheiks walkin around like kings
wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
deciding americas future from amsterdam and to paris
and theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
mans ego is inflated his laws are outdated they dont apply no more
you cant rely no more to be standin around waitin'
in the home of the brave
jefferson turnin over in his grave
fools glorifying themselves trying to manipulate satan
and theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
big-time negotiators false healers and woman haters
masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
but the enemy i see
wears a cloak of decency
all nonbelievers and men stealers talkin in the name of religion
and theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
people starving and thirsting grain elevators are bursting
oh you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
they say lose your inhibitions
follow your own ambitions
they talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
theres a slow slow train comin up around the bend
well my baby went to illinois with some bad-talkin boy she could destroy
a real suicide case but there was nothin i could do to stop it

well im hangin on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i wont let go and i cant let go wont let go
and i cant let go wont let go and i cant let go no more

people are expecting a false peace to come
well im hangin on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i wont let go and i cant let go wont let go
and i cant let go wont let go and i cant let go no more

using all the devices under the sun
and he never give up til the battles lost or won
well im hangin on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i wont let go and i cant let go wont let go
and i cant let go wont let go and i cant let go no more

they say eat drink and be merry
take the bull by the horns
i keep seeing visions of you a lily among thorns
everything looks a little far away to me
gettin harder and harder to recognize the trap
too much information about nothin
too much educated rap
its just like you told me just like you said it would be
the moon rising like wildfire
i feel the breath of a storm
something i got to do tonight
you go inside and stay warm
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
you—
yeah you got a hold of my heart
just got back from a city of flaming red skies
everybody thinks with their stomach
theres plenty of spies
every street is crooked they just wind around till they disappear
madame butterfly she lulled me to sleep
like an ancient river
so wide and deep
she said be easy baby aint nothin worth stealin here
youre the one ive been waitin for
youre the one i desire
but you must first realize
im not another man for hire
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
you you you you
yeah you got a hold of my heart
hear that hot-blooded singer
on the bandstand croon
september song memphis in june
while theyre beating the devil out of a guy whos wearing a powder blue wig
i been to babylon
i gotta confess
i could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance close up is never that big
never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
never could learn to look at your face and call it mine
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
someones got a hold of my heart
you—
yeah you got a hold of my heart
something there is about you that strikes a match in me
is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free
or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
somethin that crossed over from another century
thought id shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
rainy days on the great lakes walkin the hills of old duluth
there was me and danny lopez cold eyes black night and then there was ruth
something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth
suddenly i found you and the spirit in me sings
dont have to look no further youre the soul of many things
i could say that id be faithful i could say it in one sweet easy breath
but to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death
something there is about you that moves with style and grace
i was in a whirlwind now im in some better place
my hands on the sabre and youve picked up the baton
somethin there is about you that i cant quite put my finger on
something is burning baby are you aware
something is the matter baby theres smoke in your hair
are you still my friend baby show me a sign
is the love in your heart for me turning blind
youve been avoiding the main streets for a long long while
the truth that im seeking is in your missing file
whats your position baby whats going on
why is the light in your eyes nearly gone
i know everything about this place or so it seems
am i no longer a part of your plans or your dreams
well it is so obvious that something has changed
whats happening baby to make you act so strange
something is burning baby heres what i say
even the bloodhounds of london couldnt find you today
i see the shadow of a man baby makin you blue
who is he baby and whats he to you
weve reached the edge of the road baby where the pasture begins
where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
but where do you live baby and where is the light
why are your eyes just staring off in the night
i can feel it in the night when i think of you
i can feel it in the light and its got to be true
you cant live by bread alone you wont be satisfied
you cant roll away the stone if your hands are tied
got to start someplace baby can you explain
please dont fade away on me baby like the midnight train
answer me baby a casual look will do
just what in the world has come over you
i can feel it in the wind and its upside down
i can feel it in the dust as i get off the bus on the outskirts of town
ive had the mexico city blues since the last hairpin curve
i dont wanna see you bleed i know what you need but it aint what you deserve
something is burning baby somethings in flames
theres a man going round calling names
ring down when youre ready baby im waiting for you
i believe in the impossible you know that i do
im out here a thousand miles from my home
walkin a road other men have gone down
im seein your world of people and things
your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
hey hey woody guthrie i wrote you a song
bout a funny ol world thats a-comin along

heres to the hearts and the hands of the men
that come with the dust and are gone with the wind
im a-leavin tomorrow but i could leave today
somewhere down the road someday
the very last thing that id want to do
is to say ive been hittin some hard travelin too
gypsy gal the hands of harlem
cannot hold you to its heat
your temperatures too hot for taming
your flaming feet burn up the street
i am homeless come and take me
into reach of your rattling drums
let me know babe about my fortune
down along my restless palms
gypsy gal you got me swallowed
i have fallen far beneath
your pearly eyes so fast an slashing
an your flashing diamond teeth
the night is pitch black come an make my
pale face fit into place ah please!
let me know babe im nearly drowning
if its you my lifelines trace
i been wondrin all about me
ever since i seen you there
on the cliffs of your wildcat charms im riding
i know im round you but i dont know where
you have slayed me you have made me
i got to laugh halfways off my heels
i got to know babe will you surround me
so i can tell if im really real
spirit on the water
darkness on the face of the deep
i keep thinking about you baby
i can't hardly sleep
i'm traveling by land
traveling through the dawn of day
you're always on my mind
i can't stay away
i'd forgotten about you
then you turned up again
i always knew
that we were meant to be more than friends
when you are near
it's just as plain as it can be
i'm wild about you gal
you ought to be a fool about me
can't explain
the sources of this hidden pain
you burned your way into my heart
you got the key to my brain
i've been trampling through mud
praying to the powers above
i'm sweating blood
you got a face that begs for love
life without you
doesn't mean a thing to me
if i can't have you
i'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
sometimes i wonder
why you can't treat me right
you do good all day
then you do wrong all night
when you're with me
i'm a thousand times happier than i could ever say
what does it matter
what price i pay
they brag about your sugar
brag about it all over town
put some sugar in my bowl
i feel like laying down
i'm pale as a ghost
holding a blossom on a stem
you ever seen a ghost no
but you have heard of them
i see you there
i'm blinded by the colors i see
i take good care
of what belongs to me
i hear your name
ringing up and down the line
i'm saying it plain
these ties are strong enough to bind
your sweet voice
calls out from some old familiar shrine
i got no choice
can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
i could live forever
with you perfectly
you don't ever
have to make a fuss over me
from east to west
ever since the world began
i only mean it for the best
i want to be with you any way i can
i been in a brawl
now i'm feeling the wall
i'm going away baby
i won't be back ‘til fall
high on the hill
you can carry all my thoughts with you
you've numbed my will
this love could tear me in two
i wanna be with you in paradise
and it seems so unfair
i can't go to paradise no more
i killed a man back there
you think i'm over the hill
you think i'm past my prime
let me see what you got
we can have a whoppin' good time

im walking through the summer nights
jukebox playing low
yesterday everything was going too fast
today its moving too slow
i got no place left to turn
i got nothing left to burn
dont know if i saw you if i would kiss you or kill you
it probably wouldnt matter to you anyhow
you left me standing in the doorway crying
i got nothing to go back to now
the light in this place is so bad
making me sick in the head
all the laughter is just making me sad
the stars have turned cherry red
im strumming on my gay guitar
smoking a cheap cigar
the ghost of our old love has not gone away
dont look like it will anytime soon
you left me standing in the doorway crying
under the midnight moon
maybe theyll get me and maybe they wont
but not tonight and it wont be here
there are things i could say but i dont
i know the mercy of god must be near
ive been riding the midnight train
got ice water in my veins
i would be crazy if i took you back
it would go up against every rule
you left me standing in the doorway crying
suffering like a fool
when the last rays of daylight go down
buddy youll roll no more
i can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
i wonder who theyre ringing for
i know i cant win
but my heart just wont give in
last night i danced with a stranger
but she just reminded me you were the one
you left me standing in the doorway crying
in the dark land of the sun
ill eat when im hungry drink when im dry
and live my life on the square
and even if the flesh falls off of my face
i know someone will be there to care
it always means so much
even the softest touch
i see nothing to be gained by any explanation
there are no words that need to be said
you left me standing in the doorway crying
blues wrapped around my head
well im standin on the highway
tryin to bum a ride tryin to bum a ride
tryin to bum a ride
well im standin on the highway
tryin to bum a ride tryin to bum a ride

summer days summer nights are gone
summer days summer nights are gone
i know a place where theres still somethin going on
i was in your presence for an hour or so
or was it a day i truly dont know
where the sun never set where the trees hung low
by that soft and shining sea
did you respect me for what i did
or for what i didnt do or for keeping it hid
did i lose my mind when i tried to get rid
of everything you see
in the summertime ah in the summertime
in the summertime when you were with me
i got the heart and you got the blood
we cut through iron and we cut through mud
then came the warnin that was before the flood
that set everybody free
fools they made a mock of sin
our loyalty they tried to win
but you were closer to me than my next of kin
when they didnt want to know or see
in the summertime ah in the summertime
in the summertime when you were with me
strangers they meddled in our affairs
poverty and shame was theirs
but all that sufferin was not to be compared
with the glory that is to be
and im still carrying the gift you gave
its a part of me now its been cherished and saved
itll be with me unto the grave
and then unto eternity
in the summertime ah in the summertime
in the summertime when you were with me

she wanted a whole man not just a half
she used to call me sweet daddy when i was only a child
you kind of remind me of her when you laugh
in order to deal in this game got to make the queen disappear
its done with a flick of the wrist
whats a sweetheart like you doin in a dump like this
you know a woman like you should be at home
thats where you belong
watching out for someone who loves you true
who would never do you wrong
just how much abuse will you be able to take
well theres no way to tell by that first kiss
whats a sweetheart like you doin in a dump like this
you know you can make a name for yourself
you can hear them tires squeal
you can be known as the most beautiful woman
who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal
you know news of you has come down the line
even before ya came in the door
they say in your fathers house theres many mansions
each one of them got a fireproof floor
snap out of it baby people are jealous of you
they smile to your face but behind your back they hiss
whats a sweetheart like you doin in a dump like this
got to be an important person to be in here honey
got to have done some evil deed
got to have your own harem when you come in the door
got to play your harp until your lips bleed
they say that patriotism is the last refuge
to which a scoundrel clings
steal a little and they throw you in jail
steal a lot and they make you king
theres only one step down from here baby
its called the land of permanent bliss
whats a sweetheart like you doin in a dump like this
i saw it advertised one day

that old ship sinkin down in the water
six thousand people tryin t kill each other
dogs a-barkin cats a-meowin
women screamin fists a-flyin babies cryin
cops a-comin me a-runnin
maybe we just better call off the picnic
i got shoved down n pushed around
all i could hear there was a screamin sound
dont remember one thing more
just remember wakin up on a little shore
head busted stomach cracked
feet splintered i was bald naked . . .
quite lucky to be alive though
feelin like i climbed outa m casket
i grabbed back hold of m picnic basket

i think we oughta take some o these people
and put em on a boat send em up to bear mountain . . .
for a picnic
here's a foreign song i learned in utah
ha-va-ne-gei-lah
o-de-ley-e-e-oo-
well i was feelin sad and feelin blue
i didnt know what in the world i wus gonna do
them communists they wus comin around
they wus in the air
they wus on the ground
they wouldnt gimme no peace . . .
so i run down most hurriedly
and joined up with the john birch society
i got me a secret membership card
and started off a-walkin down the road
yee-hoo im a real john bircher now!
look out you commies!
now we all agree with hitlers views
although he killed six million jews
it dont matter too much that he was a fascist
at least you cant say he was a communist!
thats to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria
well i wus lookin everywhere for them gol-darned reds
i got up in the mornin n looked under my bed
looked in the sink behind the door
looked in the glove compartment of my car
couldnt find em . . .
i wus lookin high an low for them reds everywhere
i wus lookin in the sink an underneath the chair
i looked way up my chimney hole
i even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
they got away . . .
well i wus sittin home alone an started to sweat
figured they wus in my t.v. set
peeked behind the picture frame
got a shock from my feet hittin right up in the brain
them reds caused it!
i know they did . . . them hard-core ones
well i quit my job so i could work all alone
then i changed my name to sherlock holmes
followed some clues from my detective bag
and discovered they wus red stripes on the american flag!
that ol betsy ross . . .
well i investigated all the books in the library
ninety percent of em gotta be burned away
i investigated all the people that i knowed
ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
the other two percent are fellow birchers . . . just like me
now eisenhower hes a russian spy
lincoln jefferson and that roosevelt guy
to my knowledge theres just one man
thats really a true american: george lincoln rockwell
i know for a fact he hates commies cus he picketed the movie exodus
well i finly started thinkin straight
when i run outa things to investigate
couldnt imagine doin anything else
so now im sittin home investigatin myself!
hope i dont find out anything . . . hmm great god!
ramblin outa the wild west
leavin the towns i love the best
thought id seen some ups and downs
til i come into new york town
people goin down to the ground
buildings goin up to the sky
wintertime in new york town
the wind blowin snow around
walk around with nowhere to go
somebody could freeze right to the bone
i froze right to the bone
new york times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
i didnt feel so cold then
i swung onto my old guitar
grabbed hold of a subway car
and after a rocking reeling rolling ride
i landed up on the downtown side
greenwich village
i walked down there and ended up
in one of them coffee-houses on the block
got on the stage to sing and play
man there said come back some other day
you sound like a hillbilly
we want folk singers here
well i got a harmonica job begun to play
blowin my lungs out for a dollar a day
i blowed inside out and upside down
the man there said he loved m sound
he was ravin about how he loved m sound
dollar a days worth
and after weeks and weeks of hangin around
i finally got a job in new york town
in a bigger place bigger money too
even joined the union and paid m dues
now a very great man once said
that some people rob you with a fountain pen
it didnt take too long to find out
just what he was talkin about
a lot of people dont have much food on their table
but they got a lot of forks n knives
and they gotta cut somethin
so one mornin when the sun was warm
i rambled out of new york town
pulled my cap down over my eyes
and headed out for the western skies
so long new york
howdy east orange
some time ago a crazy dream came to me
i dreamt i was walkin into world war three
i went to the doctor the very next day
to see what kinda words he could say
he said it was a bad dream
i wouldnt worry bout it none though
they were my own dreams and theyre only in my head
i said hold it doc a world war passed through my brain
he said nurse get your pad this boys insane
he grabbed my arm i said ouch!
as i landed on the psychiatric couch
he said tell me about it
well the whole thing started at 3 oclock fast
it was all over by quarter past
i was down in the sewer with some little lover
when i peeked out from a manhole cover
wondering who turned the lights on
well i got up and walked around
and up and down the lonesome town
i stood a-wondering which way to go
i lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
it was a normal day
well i rung the fallout shelter bell
and i leaned my head and i gave a yell
give me a string bean im a hungry man
a shotgun fired and away i ran
i dont blame them too much though i know i look funny
down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
i seen a man
i said howdy friend i guess theres just us two
he screamed a bit and away he flew
thought i was a communist
well i spied a girl and before she could leave
lets go and play adam and eve
i took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin
when she said hey man you crazy or sumpin
you see what happened last time they started
well i seen a cadillac window uptown
and there was nobody aroun
i got into the drivers seat
and i drove down 42nd street
in my cadillac. good car to drive after a war
well i remember seein some ad
so i turned on my conelrad
but i didnt pay my con ed bill
so the radio didnt work so well
turned on my record player—
it was rock-a-day johnny singin tell your ma tell your pa
our loves a-gonna grow ooh-wah ooh-wah
i was feelin kinda lonesome and blue
i needed somebody to talk to
so i called up the operator of time
just to hear a voice of some kind
when you hear the beep it will be three oclock
she said that for over an hour
and i hung up
well the doctor interrupted me just about then
sayin hey ive been havin the same old dreams
but mine was a little different you see
i dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
i didnt see you around
well now time passed and now it seems
everybodys having them dreams
everybody sees themselves
walkin around with no one else
half of the people can be part right all of the time
some of the people can be all right part of the time
but all of the people cant be all right all of the time
i think abraham lincoln said that
ill let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours
i said that
early one mornin the sun was shinin
i was layin in bed
wondrin if shed changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said our lives together
sure was gonna be rough
they never did like mamas homemade dress
papas bankbook wasnt big enough
and i was standin on the side of the road
rain fallin on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows ive paid some dues gettin through
tangled up in blue
she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam i guess
but i used a little too much force
we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
she turned around to look at me
as i was walkin away
i heard her say over my shoulder
well meet again someday on the avenue
tangled up in blue
i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i happened to be employed
workin for a while on a fishin boat
right outside of delacroix
but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind and i just grew
tangled up in blue
she was workin in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept lookin at the side of her face
in the spotlight so clear
and later on as the crowd thinned out
is just about to do the same
she was standing there in back of my chair
said to me dont i know your name
i muttered somethin underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
tangled up in blue
she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
i thought youd never say hello she said
you look like the silent type
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burnin coal
pourin off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue
i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafés at night
and revolution in the air
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when finally the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue
so now im goin back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
theyre an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are carpenters wives
dont know how it all got started
i dont know what theyre doin with their lives
but me im still on the road
headin for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point of view
tangled up in blue
we carried you in our arms
on independence day
and now youd throw us all aside
and put us on our way
oh what dear daughter neath the sun
would treat a father so
to wait upon him hand and foot
and always tell him no
tears of rage tears of grief
why must i always be the thief
come to me now you know
were so alone
and life is brief
we pointed out the way to go
and scratched your name in sand
though you just thought it was nothing more
than a place for you to stand
now i want you to know that while we watched
you discover there was no one true
most evrybody really thought
it was a childish thing to do
tears of rage tears of grief
must i always be the thief
come to me now you know
were so low
and life is brief
it was all very painless
when you went out to receive
all that false instruction
which we never could believe
and now the heart is filled with gold
as if it was a purse
but oh what kind of love is this
which goes from bad to worse
tears of rage tears of grief
must i always be the thief
come to me now you know
were so low
and life is brief
i have heard rumors all over town
they say that youre planning to put me down
all i would like you to do
is tell me that it isnt true
they say that youve been seen with some other man
that hes tall dark and handsome and youre holding his hand
darlin im a-countin on you
tell me that it isnt true
to know that some other man is holdin you tight
it hurts me all over it doesnt seem right
all of those awful things that i have heard
i dont want to believe them all i want is your word
so darlin you better come through
tell me that it isnt true
all of those awful things that i have heard
i dont want to believe them all i want is your word
so darlin im countin on you
tell me that it isnt true
ol black bascom dont break no mirrors

standing on your window honey
yes ive been here before
feeling so harmless
im looking at your second door
how come you dont send me no regards
you know i want your lovin
honey why are you so hard
kneeling neath your ceiling
yes i guess ill be here for a while
im tryin to read your portrait but
im helpless like a rich mans child
how come you send someone out to have me barred
you know i want your lovin
honey why are you so hard
like a poor fool in his prime
yes i know you can hear me walk
but is your heart made out of stone or is it lime
or is it just solid rock
well i rush into your hallway
lean against your velvet door
i watch upon your scorpion
who crawls across your circus floor
just what do you think you have to guard
you know i want your lovin
honey but youre so hard
achilles is in your alleyway
he dont want me here he does brag
hes pointing to the sky
and hes hungry like a man in drag
how come you get someone like him to be your guard
you know i want your lovin
honey but youre so hard
a worried man with a worried mind
no one in front of me and nothing behind
theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
got white skin got assassins eyes
im looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
im well dressed waiting on the last train
standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
any minute now im expecting all hell to break loose
people are crazy and times are strange
im locked in tight im out of range
i used to care but things have changed
this place aint doing me any good
im in the wrong town i should be in hollywood
just for a second there i thought i saw something move
gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
aint no shortcuts gonna dress in drag
only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove
lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too
dont get up gentlemen im only passing through
people are crazy and times are strange
im locked in tight im out of range
i used to care but things have changed
ive been walking forty miles of bad road
if the bible is right the world will explode
ive been trying to get as far away from myself as i can
some things are too hot to touch
the human mind can only stand so much
you cant win with a losing hand
feel like falling in love with the first woman i meet
putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
people are crazy and times are strange
im locked in tight im out of range
i used to care but things have changed
i hurt easy i just dont show it
you can hurt someone and not even know it
the next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
gonna get low down gonna fly high
all the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me
mr. jinx and miss lucy they jumped in the lake
im not that eager to make a mistake
people are crazy and times are strange
im locked in tight im out of range
i used to care but things have changed
three angels up above the street
each one playing a horn
dressed in green robes with wings that stick out
theyve been there since christmas morn
the wildest cat from montana passes by in a flash
then a lady in a bright orange dress
one u-haul trailer a truck with no wheels
the tenth avenue bus going west
the dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
a man with a badge skips by
three fellas crawlin on their way back to work
nobody stops to ask why
the bakery truck stops outside of that fence
where the angels stand high on their poles
the driver peeks out trying to find one face
in this concrete world full of souls
the angels play on their horns all day
the whole earth in progression seems to pass by
but does anyone hear the music they play
does anyone even try
thunder on the mountain fires on the moon
there's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
today's the day gonna grab my trombone and blow
well there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere i go
i was thinkin' 'bout alicia keys couldn't keep from crying
when she was born in hell's kitchen i was living down the line
i'm wondering where in the world alicia keys could be
i been looking for her even clear through tennessee
feel like my soul is beginning to expand
look into my heart and you will sort of understand
you brought me here now you're trying to run me away
the writing's on the wall come read it come see what it say
thunder on the mountain rolling like a drum
gonna sleep over there that's where the music coming from
i don't need any guide i already know the way
remember this i'm your servant both night and day
the pistols are poppin' and the power is down
i'd like to try somethin' but i'm so far from town
the sun keeps shinin' and the north wind keeps picking up speed
gonna forget about myself for a while gonna go out and see what others need
i've been sitting down studying the art of love
i think it will fit me like a glove
i want some real good woman to do just what i say
everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today
thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
some sweet day i'll stand beside my king
i wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
gonna raise me an army some tough sons of bitches
i'll recruit my army from the orphanages
i been to st. herman's church and i've said my religious vows
i've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
i got the porkchops she got the pie
she ain't no angel and neither am i
shame on your greed shame on your wicked schemes
i'll say this i don't give a damn about your dreams
thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
mean old twister bearing down on me
all the ladies of washington scrambling to get out of town
looks like something bad gonna happen better roll your airplane down
everybody's going and i want to go too
don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
i did all i could and i did it right there and then
i've already confessed – no need to confess again
gonna make a lot of money gonna go up north
i'll plant and i'll harvest what the earth brings forth
the hammer's on the table the pitchfork's on the shelf
for the love of god you ought to take pity on yourself
well i had to move fast
and i couldnt with you around my neck
i said id send for you and i did
what did you expect
my hands are sweating
and we havent even started yet
ill go along with the charade
until i can think my way out
i know it was all a big joke
whatever it was about
someday maybe
ill remember to forget
im gonna get my coat
i feel the breath of a storm
theres something ive got to do tonight
you go inside and stay warm
has anybody seen my love
has anybody seen my love
has anybody seen my love
i dont know
has anybody seen my love
you want to talk to me
go ahead and talk
whatever you got to say to me
wont come as any shock
i must be guilty of something
you just whisper it into my ear
madame butterfly
she lulled me to sleep
in a town without pity
where the water runs deep
she said be easy baby
there aint nothin worth stealin in here
youre the one ive been looking for
youre the one thats got the key
but i cant figure out whether im too good for you
or youre too good for me
has anybody seen my love
has anybody seen my love
has anybody seen my love
i dont know
has anybody seen my love
well theyre not showing any lights tonight
and theres no moon
theres just a hot-blooded singer
singing memphis in june
while theyre beatin the devil out of a guy
whos wearing a powder-blue wig
later hell be shot
for resisting arrest
i can still hear his voice crying
in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance
close up aint never that big
never could learn to drink that blood
and call it wine
never could learn to hold you love
and call you mine
well my nerves are exploding and my bodys tense
i feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
ive been hit too hard ive seen too much
nothing can heal me now but your touch
i dont know what im gonna do
i was all right til i fell in love with you
well my house is on fire burning to the sky
i thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
now i feel like im coming to the end of my way
but i know god is my shield and he wont lead me astray
still i dont know what im gonna do
i was all right til i fell in love with you
boys in the street beginning to play
girls like birds flying away
when im gone you will remember my name
im gonna win my way to wealth and fame
i dont know what im gonna do
i was all right til i fell in love with you
junk is piling up taking up space
my eyes feel like theyre falling off my face
sweat falling down im staring at the floor
im thinking about that girl who wont be back no more
i dont know what im gonna do
i was all right til i fell in love with you
well im tired of talking im tired of trying to explain
my attempts to please you were all in vain
tomorrow night before the sun goes down
if im still among the living ill be dixie bound
i just dont know what im gonna do
i was all right til i fell in love with you
time passes slowly up here in the mountains
we sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
time passes slowly when youre lost in a dream
once i had a sweetheart she was fine and good-lookin
we sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin
stared out the window to the stars high above
time passes slowly when youre searchin for love
aint no reason to go in a wagon to town
aint no reason to go to the fair
aint no reason to go up aint no reason to go down
aint no reason to go anywhere
time passes slowly up here in the daylight
we stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
time passes slowly and fades away
come gather round people
wherever you roam
and admit that the waters
around you have grown
and accept it that soon
youll be drenched to the bone
if your time to you is worth savin
then you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone
for the times they are a-changin
come writers and critics
who prophesize with your pen
and keep your eyes wide
the chance wont come again
and dont speak too soon
for the wheels still in spin
and theres no tellin who that its namin
for the loser now will be later to win
for the times they are a-changin
come senators congressmen
please heed the call
dont stand in the doorway
dont block up the hall
for he that gets hurt
will be he who has stalled
theres a battle outside and it is ragin
itll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
for the times they are a-changin
come mothers and fathers
throughout the land
and dont criticize
what you cant understand
your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command
your old road is rapidly agin
please get out of the new one if you cant lend your hand
for the times they are a-changin
the line it is drawn
the curse it is cast
the slow one now
will later be fast
as the present now
will later be past
the order is rapidly fadin
and the first one now will later be last
for the times they are a-changin

the sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
the city fathers theyre trying to endorse
the reincarnation of paul reveres horse
but the town has no need to be nervous
the ghost of belle starr she hands down her wits
to jezebel the nun she violently knits
a bald wig for jack the ripper who sits
at the head of the chamber of commerce
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
the hysterical bride in the penny arcade
screaming she moans ive just been made
then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
says my advice is to not let the boys in
now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
he walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
stop all this weeping swallow your pride
you will not die its not poison
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
well john the baptist after torturing a thief
looks up at his hero the commander-in-chief
saying tell me great hero but please make it brief
is there a hole for me to get sick in
the commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly
saying death to all those who would whimper and cry
and dropping a barbell he points to the sky
saying the suns not yellow its chicken
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
the king of the philistines his soldiers to save
puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
then sends them out to the jungle
gypsy davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
with his faithful slave pedro behind him he tramps
with a fantastic collection of stamps
to win friends and influence his uncle
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
the geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
causes galileos math book to get thrown
at delilah who sits worthlessly alone
but the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
now i wish i could give brother bill his great thrill
i would set him in chains at the top of the hill
then send out for some pillars and cecil b. demille
he could die happily ever after
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
where ma rainey and beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
and the national bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
to the old folks home and the college
now i wish i could write you a melody so plain
that could hold you dear lady from going insane
that could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
of your useless and pointless knowledge
mamas in the factry
she aint got no shoes
daddys in the alley
hes lookin for the fuse
im in the streets
with the tombstone blues
if today was not an endless highway
if tonight was not a crooked trail
if tomorrow wasnt such a long time
then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
yes and only if my own true love was waitin
yes and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin
only if she was lyin by me
then id lie in my bed once again
i cant see my reflection in the waters
i cant speak the sounds that show no pain
i cant hear the echo of my footsteps
or cant remember the sound of my own name
yes and only if my own true love was waitin
yes and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin
only if she was lyin by me
then id lie in my bed once again
theres beauty in the silver singin river
theres beauty in the sunrise in the sky
but none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
that i remember in my true loves eyes
yes and only if my own true love was waitin
yes and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin
only if she was lyin by me
then id lie in my bed once again
tomorrow night will you remember what you said to night
tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone
tomorrow night will it be just another memory
or just another song that's in my heart to linger on
your lips are so tender your heart is beating fast
and you willingly surrender to me my darling will it last
tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright
tomorrow night will you say those lovely things you said tonight
your lips are so tender your heart is beating fast
and you willingly surrender to me my darling will it last
tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright
tomorrow night will you say those lovely things you said tonight
throw my ticket out the window
throw my suitcase out there too
throw my troubles out the door
i dont need them anymore
cause tonight ill be staying here with you
i should have left this town this morning
but it was more than i could do
oh your love comes on so strong
and ive waited all day long
for tonight when ill be staying here with you
is it really any wonder
the love that a stranger might receive
you cast your spell and i went under
i find it so difficult to leave
i can hear that whistle blowin
i see that stationmaster too
if theres a poor boy on the street
then let him have my seat
cause tonight ill be staying here with you
throw my ticket out the window
throw my suitcase out there too
throw my troubles out the door
i dont need them anymore
cause tonight ill be staying here with you
now too much of nothing
can make a man feel ill at ease
one mans temper might rise
while another mans temper might freeze
in the day of confession
we cannot mock a soul
oh when theres too much of nothing
no one has control
say hello to valerie
say hello to vivian
send them all my salary
on the waters of oblivion
too much of nothing
can make a man abuse a king
he can walk the streets and boast like most
but he wouldnt know a thing
now its all been done before
its all been written in the book
but when theres too much of nothing
nobody should look
say hello to valerie
say hello to vivian
send them all my salary
on the waters of oblivion
too much of nothing
can turn a man into a liar
it can cause one man to sleep on nails
and another man to eat fire
evrybodys doin somethin
i heard it in a dream
but when theres too much of nothing
it just makes a fella mean
say hello to valerie
say hello to vivian
send them all my salary
on the waters of oblivion
tough mama
meat shakin on your bones
im gonna go down to the river and get some stones
sisters on the highway with that steel-drivin crew
papas in the big house his workin days are through
tough mama
can i blow a little smoke on you
dark beauty
wont you move it on over and make some room
its my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
ashes in the furnace dust on the rise
you came through it all the way flyin through the skies
dark beauty
with that long nights journey in your eyes
sweet goddess
born of a blinding light and a changing wind
now dont be modest you know who you are and where youve been
jack the cowboy went up north
hes buried in your past
the lone wolf went out drinking
that was over pretty fast
sweet goddess
your perfect strangers comin in at last
silver angel
with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve
id be grateful if this golden ring you would receive
today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
i stood alone upon the ridge and all i did was watch
sweet goddess
it must be time to carve another notch
im crestfallen
the world of illusion is at my door
i aint a-haulin any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
the prison walls are crumblin there is no end in sight
ive gained some recognition but i lost my appetite
dark beauty
meet me at the border late tonight
trouble in the city trouble in the farm
you got your rabbits foot you got your good-luck charm
but they cant help you none when theres trouble
trouble
trouble trouble trouble
nothin but trouble
trouble in the water trouble in the air
go all the way to the other side of the world youll find trouble there
revolution even aint no solution for trouble
trouble
trouble trouble trouble
nothin but trouble
drought and starvation packaging of the soul
persecution execution governments out of control
you can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble
trouble
trouble trouble trouble
nothin but trouble
put your ear to the train tracks put your ear to the ground
you ever feel like youre never alone even when theres nobody else around
since the beginning of the universe mans been cursed by trouble
trouble
trouble trouble trouble
nothin but trouble
nightclubs of the broken-hearted stadiums of the damned
legislature perverted nature doors that are rudely slammed
look into infinity all you see is trouble
trouble
trouble trouble trouble
nothin but trouble
im getting weary looking in my babys eyes
when shes near me shes so hard to recognize
i finally realize theres no room for regret
true love true love true love tends to forget
hold me baby be near
you told me that youd be sincere
every day of the years like playin russian roulette
true love true love true love tends to forget
i was lyin down in the reeds without any oxygen
i saw you in the wilderness among the men
saw you drift into infinity and come back again
all you got to do is wait and ill tell you when
youre a tearjerker baby but im under your spell
youre a hard worker baby and i know you well
but this weekend in hell is making me sweat
true love true love true love tends to forget
i was lyin down in the reeds without any oxygen
i saw you in the wilderness among the men
saw you drift into infinity and come back again
all you got to do is wait and ill tell you when
you belong to me baby without any doubt
dont forsake me baby dont sell me out
dont keep me knockin about from mexico to tibet
true love true love true love tends to forget
trust yourself
trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
trust yourself
trust yourself to do whats right and not be second-guessed
dont trust me to show you beauty
when beauty may only turn to rust
if you need somebody you can trust trust yourself
trust yourself
trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
trust yourself
trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
dont trust me to show you the truth
when the truth may only be ashes and dust
if you want somebody you can trust trust yourself
well youre on your own you always were
in a land of wolves and thieves
dont put your hope in ungodly man
or be a slave to what somebody else believes
trust yourself
and you wont be disappointed when vain people let you down
trust yourself
and look not for answers where no answers can be found
dont trust me to show you love
when my love may be only lust
if you want somebody you can trust trust yourself
the air is getting hotter
theres a rumbling in the skies
ive been wading through the high muddy water
with the heat rising in my eyes
every day your memory grows dimmer
it doesnt haunt me like it did before
ive been walking through the middle of nowhere
trying to get to heaven before they close the door
when i was in missouri
they would not let me be
i had to leave there in a hurry
i only saw what they let me see
you broke a heart that loved you
now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
ive been walking that lonesome valley
trying to get to heaven before they close the door
people on the platforms
waiting for the trains
i can hear their hearts a-beatin
like pendulums swinging on chains
i tried to give you everything
that your heart was longing for
im just going down the road feeling bad
trying to get to heaven before they close the door
im going down the river
down to new orleans
they tell me everything is gonna be all right
but i dont know what all right even means
i was riding in a buggy with miss mary-jane
miss mary-jane got a house in baltimore
i been all around the world boys
now im trying to get to heaven before they close the door
gonna sleep down in the parlor
and relive my dreams
ill close my eyes and i wonder
if everything is as hollow as it seems
some trains don't pull no gamblers
no midnight ramblers like they did before
i been to sugar town i shook the sugar down
now im trying to get to heaven before they close the door
instrumental
one time in london id gone out for a walk
past a place called hyde park where people talk
bout all kinds of different gods they have their point of view
to anyone passing by thats who theyre talking to
there was someone on a platform talking to the folks
about the t.v. god and all the pain that it invokes
its too bright a light he said for anybodys eyes
if youve never seen one its a blessing in disguise
i moved in closer got up on my toes
two men in front of me were coming to blows
the man was saying something bout children when theyre young
being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung
the news of the day is on all the time
all the latest gossip all the latest rhyme
your mind is your temple keep it beautiful and free
dont let an egg get laid in it by something you cant see
pray for peace! he said. you could feel it in the crowd
my thoughts began to wander. his voice was ringing loud
it will destroy your family your happy home is gone
no one can protect you from it once you turn it on
it will lead you into some strange pursuits
lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
it will scramble up your head and drag your brain about
sometimes you gotta do like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out
its all been designed he said to make you lose your mind
and when you go back to find it theres nothing there to find
every time you look at it your situations worse
if you feel it grabbing out for you send for the nurse
the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
there was pushing there was shoving and everybody ran
the t.v. crew was there to film it they jumped right over me
later on that evening i watched it on t.v.
tweedle-dee dum and tweedle-dee dee
theyre throwing knives into the tree
two big bags of dead mans bones
got their noses to the grindstones
living in the land of nod
trustin their fate to the hands of god
they pass by so silently
tweedle-dee dum and tweedle-dee dee
well theyre going to the country theyre gonna retire
theyre taking a street car named desire
looking in the window at the pecan pie
lot of things theyd like they would never buy
neither one gonna turn and run
theyre making a voyage to the sun
his masters voice is calling me
says tweedle-dee dum to tweedle-dee dee
tweedle-dee dee and tweedle-dee dum
all that and more and then some
they walk among the stately trees
they know the secrets of the breeze
tweedle-dee dum said to tweedle-dee dee
your presence is obnoxious to me
theyre like babies sittin on a womans knee
tweedle-dee dum and tweedle-dee dee
well the rain beating down on my window pane
i got love for you and its all in vain
brains in the pot theyre beginning to boil
theyre dripping with garlic and olive oil
tweedle-dee dee—hes on his hands and his knees
saying throw me somethin mister please
whats good for you is good for me
says tweedle-dee dum to tweedle-dee dee
well theyre living in a happy harmony
tweedle-dee dum and tweedle-dee dee
theyre one day older and a dollar short
theyve got a parade permit and a police escort
theyre lying low and theyre makin hay
they seem determined to go all the way
they run a brick-and-tile company
tweedle-dee dum and tweedle-dee dee
well a childish dream is a deathless need
and a noble truth is a sacred dream
my pretty baby shes lookin around
shes wearin a multi-thousand dollar gown
tweedle-dee dee is a lowdown sorry old man
tweedle-dee dum hell stab you where you stand
ive had too much of your company
says tweedle-dee dum to tweedle-dee dee
he was just a blue-eyed boston boy
his voice was low with pain.
i'll do your bidding comrade mine
if i ride back again.
but if you ride back and i am left
you'll do as much for me
mother you know must hear the news
so write to her tenderly.
she's waiting at home like a patient saint
her fond face pale with woe.
her heart will be broken when i am gone
i'll see her soon i know.
just then the order came to charge
for an instance hand touched hand.
they said aye and away they rode
that brave and devoted band.
straight was the track to the top of the hill
the rebels they shot and shelled
plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
and guarded them as they fell.
there soon came a horrible dying yell
from heights that they could not gain
and those whom doom and death had spared
rode slowly back again.
but among the dead that were left on the hill
was the boy with the curly hair.
the tall dark man who rode by his side
lay dead beside him there.
there's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
the words that her lover had said.
momma you know awaits the news
and she'll only know he's dead.
the woman that i love she got a hook in her nose
her eyebrows meet she wears second hand clothes
she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
i don't know why i love her but i just can't stop
you know i love her
yeah i love her
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
if i ever lose her i will go insane
i go half crazy when she calls my name
when she says babababababy i l-l-love you
there ain't nothing in the world that i wouldn't do
you know i love her
yeah i love her
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
the woman that i love she got two flat feet
her knees knock together walking down the street
she cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
she ain't much to look at but like i said
you know i love her
yeah i love her
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
i don't mean to say that she got nothing goin'
she got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
when i get low she sets me on my feet
got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet
you know i love her
yeah i love her
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
the woman that i love she a got a prizefighter nose
cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
i don't know why i love her but i just can't stop
its unbelievable its strange but true
its inconceivable it could happen to you
you go north and you go south
just like bait in the fishs mouth
ya must be livin in the shadow of some kind of evil star
its unbelievable it would get this far
its undeniable what theyd have you to think
its indescribable it can drive you to drink
they said it was the land of milk and honey
now they say its the land of money
who ever thought they could ever make that stick
its unbelievable you can get this rich this quick
every head is so dignified
every moon is so sanctified
every urge is so satisfied as long as youre with me
all the silver all the gold
all the sweethearts you can hold
that dont come back with stories untold
are hanging on a tree
its unbelievable like a lead balloon
its so impossible to even learn the tune
kill that beast and feed that swine
scale that wall and smoke that vine
feed that horse and saddle up the drum
its unbelievable the day would finally come
once there was a man who had no eyes
every lady in the land told him lies
he stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed
every brain is civilized
every nerve is analyzed
everything is criticized when you are in need
its unbelievable its fancy-free
so interchangeable so delightful to see
turn your back wash your hands
theres always someone who understands
it dont matter no more what you got to say
its unbelievable it would go down this way
there was a little boy and there was a little girl
and they lived in an alley under the red sky
there was a little boy and there was a little girl
and they lived in an alley under the red sky
there was an old man and he lived in the moon
one summers day he came passing by
there was an old man and he lived in the moon
and one day he came passing by
someday little girl everything for you is gonna be new
someday little girl youll have a diamond as big as your shoe
let the wind blow low let the wind blow high
one day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
let the wind blow low let the wind blow high
one day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
this is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
this is the blind horse that leads you around
let the bird sing let the bird fly
one day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
let the bird sing let the bird fly
the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
somethin about you that i cant shake
dont know how much more of this i can take
baby im under your spell
i was knocked out and loaded in the naked night

i trusted you baby you can trust me now

baby two feet from the well
well my shoes they come from singapore
my flashlights from taiwan

and the car i drive is a chevrolet
it was put together down in argentina
by a guy makin thirty cents a day
well its sundown on the union
and whats made in the u.s.a.

til greed got in the way
well this silk dress is from hong kong
and the pearls are from japan
well the dog collars from india
and the flower pots from pakistan
all the furniture it says made in brazil
where a woman she slaved for sure
bringin home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
you know thats a lot of money to her
well its sundown on the union
and whats made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
til greed got in the way
well you know lots of people complainin that there is no work
i say why you say that for
when nothin you got is u.s.–made
they dont make nothin here no more
you know capitalism is above the law
it say it dont count less it sells
when it costs too much to build it at home
you just build it cheaper someplace else
well its sundown on the union
and whats made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
til greed got in the way
well the job that you used to have
they gave it to somebody down in el salvador
the unions are big business friend
and theyre goin out like a dinosaur
they used to grow food in kansas
now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
i can see the day coming when even your home garden
is gonna be against the law
well its sundown on the union
and whats made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
til greed got in the way
democracy dont rule the world
youd better get that in your head
this world is ruled by violence
but i guess thats better left unsaid
from broadway to the milky way
thats a lot of territory indeed
and a mans gonna do what he has to do
when hes got a hungry mouth to feed
well its sundown on the union
and whats made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
til greed got in the way
aint it just like the night to play tricks when youre tryin' to be so quiet
we sit here stranded though were all doin our best to deny it
and louise holds a handful of rain temptin you to defy it
lights flicker from the opposite loft
in this room the heat pipes just cough
the country music station plays soft
but theres nothing really nothing to turn off
just louise and her lover so entwined
and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind
in the empty lot where the ladies play blindmans bluff with the key chain
and the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train
we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
ask himself if its him or them thats really insane
louise shes all right shes just near
shes delicate and seems like the mirror
but she just makes it all too concise and too clear
that johannas not here
the ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face
where these visions of johanna have now taken my place
now little boy lost he takes himself so seriously
he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously
and when bringing her name up
he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
hes sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
muttering small talk at the wall while im in the hall
how can i explain
oh its so hard to get on
and these visions of johanna they kept me up past the dawn
inside the museums infinity goes up on trial
voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
you can tell by the way she smiles
see the primitive wallflower freeze
when the jelly-faced women all sneeze
hear the one with the mustache say jeeze
i cant find my knees
oh jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
but these visions of johanna they make it all seem so cruel
the peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him
sayin name me someone thats not a parasite and ill go out and say a prayer for him
but like louise always says
ya cant look at much can ya man
as she herself prepares for him
and madonna she still has not showed
we see this empty cage now corrode
where her cape of the stage once had flowed
the fiddler he now steps to the road
he writes evrythings been returned which was owed
on the back of the fish truck that loads
while my conscience explodes
the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
and these visions of johanna are now all that remain
well im walkin down the line
im walkin down the line
an im walkin down the line
my feetll be a-flyin
to tell about my troubled mind
i got a heavy-headed gal
i got a heavy-headed gal
i got a heavy-headed gal
she aint a-feelin well
when shes better only time will tell
well im walkin down the line
im walkin down the line
an im walkin down the line
my feetll be a-flyin
to tell about my troubled mind
my money comes and goes
my money comes and goes
my money comes and goes
and rolls and flows and rolls and flows
through the holes in the pockets in my clothes
well im walkin down the line
im walkin down the line
an im walkin down the line
my feetll be a-flyin
to tell about my troubled mind
i see the morning light
i see the morning light
well its not because
im an early riser
i didnt go to sleep last night
well im walkin down the line
im walkin down the line
an im walkin down the line
my feetll be a-flyin
to tell about my troubled mind
i got my walkin shoes
i got my walkin shoes
i got my walkin shoes
an i aint a-gonna lose
i believe i got the walkin blues
well im walkin down the line

wallflower wallflower

wallflower wallflower
wont you dance with me
im fallin in love with you
just like you im wondrin what im doin here
just like you im wondrin whats goin on
wallflower wallflower

the night will soon be gone
i have seen you standing in the smoky haze
and i know that youre gonna be mine one of these days
mine alone
wallflower wallflower
take a chance on me
please let me ride you home
oh the age of the inmates
i remember quite freely:
no younger than twelve
no older n seventeen
thrown in like bandits
and cast off like criminals
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
from the dirty old mess hall
you march to the brick wall
too weary to talk
and too tired to sing
oh its all afternoon
you remember your hometown
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
oh the gates are cast iron
and the walls are barbed wire
stay far from the fence
with the lectricity sting
and its keep down your head
and stay in your number
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
oh its fare thee well
to the deep hollow dungeon
farewell to the boardwalk
that takes you to the screen
and farewell to the minutes
they threaten you with it
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
its many a guard
that stands around smilin
holdin his club
like he was a king
hopin to get you
behind a wood pilin
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
the night aimed shadows
through the crossbar windows
and the wind punched hard
to make the wall-siding sing
its many a night
i pretended to be a-sleepin
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
as the rain rattled heavy
on the bunkhouse shingles
and the sounds in the night
they made my ears ring
til the keys of the guards
clicked the tune of the morning
inside the walls
the walls of red wing
oh some of usll end up
in st. cloud prison
and some of usll wind up
to be lawyers and things
and some of usll stand up
to meet you on your crossroads
from inside the walls
the walls of red wing
whats the matter with me
i dont have much to say
daylight sneakin through the window
and im still in this all-night café
walkin to and fro beneath the moon
out to where the trucks are rollin slow
to sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow
wish i was back in the city
instead of this old bank of sand
with the sun beating down over the chimney tops
and the one i love so close at hand
if i had wings and i could fly
i know where i would go
but right now ill just sit here so contentedly
and watch the river flow
people disagreeing on all just about everything yeah
makes you stop and all wonder why
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
who just couldnt help but cry
oh this ol river keeps on rollin though
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
and as long as it does ill just sit here
and watch the river flow
people disagreeing everywhere you look
makes you wanna stop and read a book
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
that was really shook
but this ol river keeps on rollin though
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
and as long as it does ill just sit here
and watch the river flow
watch the river flow
watchin the river flow
watchin the river flow
but ill sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow
love thats pure hopes all things
believes all things wont pull no strings
wont sneak up into your room tall dark and handsome
capture your heart and hold it for ransom
you dont want a love thats pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered-down love
love thats pure it dont make no false claims
intercedes for you stead of casting you blame
will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
wont write it up and make you sign a false confession
you dont want a love thats pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered-down love
love thats pure wont lead you astray
wont hold you back wont mess up your day
wont pervert you corrupt you with stupid wishes
it dont make you envious it dont make you suspicious
you dont want a love thats pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered-down love
love thats pure aint no accident
always on time is always content
an eternal flame quietly burning
never needs to be proud restlessly yearning
you dont want a love thats pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered-down love
i think we better talk this over
maybe when we both get sober
youll understand im only a man
doin the best that i can
this situation can only get rougher
why should we needlessly suffer
lets call it a day go our own different ways
before we decay
you dont have to be afraid of looking into my face
weve done nothing to each other time will not erase
i feel displaced i got a low-down feeling
you been two-faced you been double-dealing
i took a chance got caught in the trance
of a downhill dance
oh child why you wanna hurt me
im exiled you cant convert me
im lost in the haze of your delicate ways
with both eyes glazed
you dont have to yearn for love you dont have to be alone
somewheres in this universe theres a place that you can call home
i guess ill be leaving tomorrow
if i have to beg steal or borrow
itd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
look at each other and laugh
but i dont think its liable to happen
like the sound of one hand clappin
the vows that we kept are now broken and swept
neath the bed where we slept
dont think of me and fantasize on what we never had
be grateful for what weve shared together and be glad
why should we go on watching each other through a telescope
eventually well hang ourselves on all this tangled rope
oh babe time for a new transition
i wish i was a magician
i would wave a wand and tie back the bond
that weve both gone beyond
i love you more than ever more than time and more than love
i love you more than money and more than the stars above
love you more than madness more than waves upon the sea
love you more than life itself you mean that much to me
ever since you walked right in the circles been complete
ive said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
to the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
i love you more than ever and i havent yet begun
you breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
when i was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul
you gave me babies one two three what is more you saved my life
eye for eye and tooth for tooth your love cuts like a knife
my thoughts of you dont ever rest theyd kill me if i lie
id sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die
the tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
well play it out the best we know whatever it is worth
whats lost is lost we cant regain what went down in the flood
but happiness to me is you and i love you more than blood
its never been my duty to remake the world at large
nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
cause i love you more than all of that with a love that doesnt bend
and if there is eternity id love you there again
oh cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
and i was born to be with you you were born to be my bride
youre the other half of what i am youre the missing piece
and i love you more than ever with that love that doesnt cease
you turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
just bein next to you is a natural thing for me
and i could never let you go no matter what goes on
‘cause i love you more than ever now that the past is gone
went to see the gypsy
stayin in a big hotel
he smiled when he saw me coming
and he said well well well
his room was dark and crowded
lights were low and dim
how are you he said to me
i said it back to him
i went down to the lobby
to make a small call out
a pretty dancing girl was there
and she began to shout
go on back to see the gypsy
he can move you from the rear
drive you from your fear
bring you through the mirror
he did it in las vegas
and he can do it here
outside the lights were shining
on the river of tears
i watched them from the distance
with music in my ears
i went back to see the gypsy
it was nearly early dawn
the gypsys door was open wide
but the gypsy was gone
and that pretty dancing girl
she could not be found
so i watched that sun come rising
from that little minnesota town
you have given everything to me
what can i do for you
you have given me eyes to see
what can i do for you
pulled me out of bondage and you made me renewed inside
filled up a hunger that had always been denied
opened up a door no man can shut and you opened it up so wide
and youve chosen me to be among the few
what can i do for you
you have laid down your life for me
what can i do for you
you have explained every mystery
what can i do for you
soon as a man is born you know the sparks begin to fly
he gets wise in his own eyes and hes made to believe a lie
who would deliver him from the death hes bound to die
well youve done it all and theres no more anyone can pretend to do
what can i do for you
you have given all there is to give
what can i do for you
you have given me life to live
how can i live for you
i know all about poison i know all about fiery darts
i dont care how rough the road is show me where it starts
whatever pleases you tell it to my heart
well i dont deserve it but i sure did make it through
what can i do for you
what good am i if im like all the rest
if i just turn away when i see how youre dressed
if i shut myself off so i cant hear you cry
what good am i
what good am i if i know and dont do
if i see and dont say if i look right through you
if i turn a deaf ear to the thunderin sky
what good am i
what good am i while you softly weep
and i hear in my head what you say in your sleep
and i freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
what good am i
what good am i then to others and me
if ive had every chance and yet still fail to see
if my hands are tied must i not wonder within
who tied them and why and where must i have been
what good am i if i say foolish things
and i laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
and i just turn my back while you silently die
what good am i

whatever you wanted

but you know that we shall meet again
if your memry serves you well

if your memry serves you well
i was goin to confiscate your lace
and wrap it up in a sailors knot
and hide it in your case
if i knew for sure that it was yours . . .
but it was oh so hard to tell
but you knew that we would meet again
if your memry serves you well
this wheels on fire
rolling down the road
best notify my next of kin
this wheel shall explode!
if your memry serves you well
youll remember youre the one
that called on me to call on them
to get you your favors done
and after evry plan had failed
and there was nothing more to tell
you knew that we would meet again
if your memry served you well
this wheels on fire
rolling down the road
best notify my next of kin
this wheel shall explode!
in the still of the night in the world's ancient light
where wisdom grows up in strife
my bewildering brain toils in vain
through the darkness on the pathways of life
each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
tomorrow keeps turning around
we live and we die we know not why
but i'll be with you when the deal goes down
we eat and we drink we feel and we think
far down the street we stray
i laugh and i cry and i'm haunted by
things i never meant nor wished to say
the midnight rain follows the train
we all wear the same thorny crown
soul to soul our shadows roll
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
the moon gives light and shines by night
i scarcely feel the glow
we learn to live and then we forgive
o'er the road we're bound to go
more frailer than the flowers these precious hours
that keep us so tightly bound
you come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
i picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
i followed the winding stream
i heard a deafening noise i felt transient joys
i know they're not what they seem
in this earthly domain full of disappointment and pain
you'll never see me frown
i owe my heart to you and that's sayin' it true
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
the iron hand it aint no match for the iron rod
the strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god
for all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
it is only he who can reduce me to tears
dont you cry and dont you die and dont you burn
for like a thief in the night hell replace wrong with right
when he returns
truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through
he unleashed his power at an unknown hour that no one knew
how long can i listen to the lies of prejudice
how long can i stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness
can i cast it aside all this loyalty and this pride
will i ever learn that therell be no peace that the war wont cease
until he returns
surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground take off your mask
he sees your deeds he knows your needs even before you ask
how long can you falsify and deny what is real
how long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal
of every earthly plan that be known to man he is unconcerned
hes got plans of his own to set up his throne
when he returns
oh the streets of rome are filled with rubble
ancient footprints are everywhere
you can almost think that youre seein double
on a cold dark night on the spanish stairs
got to hurry on back to my hotel room
where ive got me a date with botticellis niece
she promised that shed be right there with me
when i paint my masterpiece
oh the hours ive spent inside the coliseum
dodging lions and wastin time
oh those mighty kings of the jungle i could hardly stand to see em
yes it sure has been a long hard climb
train wheels runnin through the back of my memory
when i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
when i paint my masterpiece
sailin round the world in a dirty gondola
oh to be back in the land of coca-cola!
i left rome and landed in brussels
on a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried
clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin muscles
everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside
newspapermen eating candy
had to be held down by big police
someday everything is gonna be diffrent
when i paint my masterpiece
look out across the fields see me returning
smoke is in your eye you draw a smile
from the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
youve had time to think about it for a while
well ive walked two hundred miles now look me over
its the end of the chase and the moon is high
it wont matter who loves who
youll love me or ill love you
when the night comes falling from the sky
i can see through your walls and i know youre hurting
sorrow covers you up like a cape
only yesterday i know that youve been flirting
with disaster that you managed to escape
i cant provide for you no easy answers
who are you that i should have to lie
youll know all about it love
itll fit you like a glove
when the night comes falling from the sky
i can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
you must have been protecting someone last time i called.
ive never asked you for nothing you couldnt deliver
ive never asked you to set yourself up for a fall
i saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
for the love of a lousy buck ive watched them die
stick around baby were not through
dont look for me ill see you
when the night comes falling from the sky
in your teardrops i can see my own reflection
it was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line
i dont want to be a fool starving for affection
i dont want to drown in someone elses wine
for all eternity i think i will remember
that icy wind thats howling in your eye
you will seek me and youll find me
in the wasteland of your mind
when the night comes falling from the sky
well i sent you my feelings in a letter
but you were gambling for support
this time tomorrow ill know you better
when my memory is not so short
this time im asking for freedom
freedom from a world which you deny
and youll give it to me now
ill take it anyhow
when the night comes falling from the sky
oh the time will come up
when the winds will stop
and the breeze will cease to be breathin
like the stillness in the wind
fore the hurricane begins
the hour when the ship comes in
oh the seas will split
and the ship will hit
and the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
then the tide will sound
and the wind will pound
and the morning will be breaking
oh the fishes will laugh
as they swim out of the path
and the seagulls theyll be smiling
and the rocks on the sand
will proudly stand
the hour that the ship comes in
and the words that are used
for to get the ship confused
will not be understood as theyre spoken
for the chains of the sea
will have busted in the night
and will be buried at the bottom of the ocean
a song will lift
as the mainsail shifts
and the boat drifts on to the shoreline
and the sun will respect
every face on the deck
the hour that the ship comes in
then the sands will roll
out a carpet of gold
for your weary toes to be a-touchin
and the ships wise men
will remind you once again
that the whole wide world is watchin
oh the foes will rise
with the sleep still in their eyes
and theyll jerk from their beds and think theyre dreamin
but theyll pinch themselves and squeal
and know that its for real
the hour when the ship comes in
then theyll raise their hands
sayin well meet all your demands
but well shout from the bow your days are numbered
and like pharoahs tribe
theyll be drownded in the tide
and like goliath theyll be conquered
god dont make no promises that he dont keep
you got some big dreams baby but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
karl marx has got ya by the throat henry kissingers got you tied up in knots
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
you got innocent men in jail your insane asylums are filled
you got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs thatll never cure your ills
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
you got men who cant hold their peace and women who cant control their tongues
the rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
you got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
do you ever wonder just what god requires
you think hes just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
you cant take it with you and you know that its too worthless to be sold
they tell you time is money as if your life was worth its weight in gold
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
theres a man up on a cross and hes been crucified
do you have any idea why or for who he died
when you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain
theres a long-distance train rolling through the rain
tears on the letter i write
theres a woman i long to touch and i miss her so much
but shes drifting like a satellite
theres a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze
laughter down on elizabeth street
and a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
where she bathed in a stream of pure heat
her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
but he practiced what he preached from the heart
a full-blooded cherokee he predicted to me
the time and the place that the trouble would start
theres a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
and a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
and she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
of a book that no one can write
oh where are you tonight
the truth was obscure too profound and too pure
to live it you have to explode
in that last hour of need we entirely agreed
sacrifice was the code of the road
i left town at dawn with marcel and st. john
strong men belittled by doubt
i couldnt tell her what my private thoughts were
but she had some way of finding them out
he took dead-center aim but he missed just the same
she was waiting putting flowers on the shelf
she could feel my despair as i climbed up her hair
and discovered her invisible self
theres a lion in the road theres a demon escaped
theres a million dreams gone theres a landscape being raped
as her beauty fades and i watch her undrape
i wont but then again maybe i might
oh if i could just find you tonight
i fought with my twin that enemy within
til both of us fell by the way
horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
while the law looks the other way
your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
the guy you were lovin couldnt stay clean
it felt outa place my foot in his face
but he should-a stayed where his money was green
i bit into the root of forbidden fruit
with the juice running down my leg
then i dealt with your boss whod never known about loss
and who always was too proud to beg
theres a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
and a pathway that leads up to the stars
if you dont believe theres a price for this sweet paradise
remind me to show you the scars
theres a new day at dawn and ive finally arrived
if im there in the morning baby youll know ive survived
i cant believe it i cant believe im alive
but without you it just doesnt seem right
oh where are you tonight
far away where the soft winds blow
far away from it all
there is a place you go
where teardrops fall
far away in the stormy night
far away and over the wall
you are there in the flickering light
where teardrops fall
we banged the drum slowly
and played the fife lowly
you know the song in my heart
in the turning of twilight
in the shadows of moonlight
you can show me a new place to start
ive torn my clothes and ive drained the cup
strippin away at it all
thinking of you when the sun comes up
where teardrops fall
by rivers of blindness
in love and with kindness
we could hold up a toast if we meet
to the cuttin of fences
to sharpen the senses
that linger in the fireball heat
roses are red violets are blue
and time is beginning to crawl
i just might have to come see you
where teardrops fall
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not i says the referee
dont point your finger at me
i couldve stopped it in the eighth
an maybe kept him from his fate
but the crowd wouldve booed im sure
at not gettin their moneys worth
its too bad he had to go
but there was a pressure on me too you know
it wasnt me that made him fall
no you cant blame me at all
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not us says the angry crowd
whose screams filled the arena loud
its too bad he died that night
but we just like to see a fight
we didnt mean for him t meet his death
we just meant to see some sweat
there aint nothing wrong in that
it wasnt us that made him fall
no you cant blame us at all
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not me says his manager
puffing on a big cigar
its hard to say its hard to tell
i always thought that he was well
its too bad for his wife an kids hes dead
but if he was sick he shouldve said
it wasnt me that made him fall
no you cant blame me at all
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not me says the gambling man
with his ticket stub still in his hand
it wasnt me that knocked him down
my hands never touched him none
i didnt commit no ugly sin
anyway i put money on him to win
it wasnt me that made him fall
no you cant blame me at all
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not me says the boxing writer
pounding print on his old typewriter
sayin boxing aint to blame
theres just as much danger in a football game
sayin fistfighting is here to stay
its just the old american way
it wasnt me that made him fall
no you cant blame me at all
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
not me says the man whose fists
laid him low in a cloud of mist
who came here from cubas door
where boxing aint allowed no more
i hit him yes its true
but thats what i am paid to do
dont say ‘murder dont say ‘kill
it was destiny it was gods will
who killed davey moore
why an whats the reason for
there was a wicked messenger
from eli he did come
with a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
when questioned who had sent for him
he answered with his thumb
for his tongue it could not speak but only flatter
he stayed behind the assembly hall
it was there he made his bed
oftentimes he could be seen returning
until one day he just appeared
with a note in his hand which read
the soles of my feet i swear theyre burning
oh the leaves began to fallin
and the seas began to part
and the people that confronted him were many
and he was told but these few words
which opened up his heart
if ye cannot bring good news then dont bring any
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a gypsy queen
wiggle wiggle wiggle all dressed in green
wiggle wiggle wiggle til the moon is blue
wiggle til the moon sees you
wiggle wiggle wiggle in your boots and shoes
wiggle wiggle wiggle you got nothing to lose
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a swarm of bees
wiggle on your hands and knees
wiggle to the front wiggle to the rear
wiggle til you wiggle right out of here
wiggle til it opens wiggle til it shuts
wiggle til it bites wiggle til it cuts
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a bowl of soup
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a rolling hoop
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a ton of lead
wiggle—you can raise the dead
wiggle til youre high wiggle til youre higher
wiggle til you vomit fire
wiggle til it whispers wiggle til it hums
wiggle til it answers wiggle til it comes
wiggle wiggle wiggle like satin and silk
wiggle wiggle wiggle like a pail of milk
wiggle wiggle wiggle rattle and shake
wiggle like a big fat snake

there's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town
starlight by the edge of the creek
the buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
money's gettin' shallow and weak
the place i love best is a sweet memory
it's a new path that we trod
they say low wages are a reality
if we want to compete abroad
my cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
come sit down on my knee
you are dearer to me than myself
as you yourself can see
i'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
got both eyes tight shut
just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
creeping it's way into my gut
meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
now i'm sailin' on back ready for the long haul
tossed by the winds and the seas
i'll drag ‘em all down to hell and i'll stand ‘em at the wall
i'll sell ‘em to their enemies
i'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
gonna sleep off the rest of the day
sometimes no one wants what we got
sometimes you can't give it away
now the place is ringed with countless foes
some of them may be deaf and dumb
no man no woman knows
the hour that sorrow will come
in the dark i hear the night birds call
i can hear a lover's breath
i sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
sleep is like a temporary death
meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
well they burned my barn they stole my horse
i can't save a dime
i got to be careful i don't want to be forced
into a life of continual crime
i can see for myself that the sun is sinking
how i wish you were here to see
tell me now am i wrong in thinking
that you have forgotten me
now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
they waste your nights and days
them i will forget
but you i'll remember always
old memories of you to me have clung
you've wounded me with words
gonna have to straighten out your tongue
it's all true everything you have heard
meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
in you my friend i find no blame
wanna look in my eyes please do
no one can ever claim
that i took up arms against you
all across the peaceful sacred fields
they will lay you low
they'll break your horns and slash you with steel
i say it so it must be so
now i'm down on my luck and i'm black and blue
gonna give you another chance
i'm all alone and i'm expecting you
to lead me off in a cheerful dance
got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
i can live on rice and beans
some people never worked a day in their life
don't know what work even means
meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

you angel you
you got me under your wing
the way you walk and the way you talk
i feel i could almost sing
you angel you
youre as fine as anythings fine
the way you walk and the way you talk
it sure plays on my mind
you know i cant sleep at night for trying
never did feel this way before
i get up at night and walk the floor
if this is love then gimme more
and more and more and more and more
you angel you
youre as fine as can be
the way you smile like a sweet baby child
it just falls all over me
you know i cant sleep at night for trying
never did feel this way before
never did get up and walk the floor
if this is love then gimme more
and more and more and more
you angel you
you got me under your wing
the way you walk and the way you talk
it says everything
i was listening to the voices of death on parade
singing about conspiracy wanted me to be afraid
working for a system i couldn't understand or trust
suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust
but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
talk about salvation people suddenly get tired
they got a million things to do they're all so inspired
you do the work of the devil you got a million friends
they'll be there when you got something they'll take it all in the end
but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
i was under the gun clouds blocking the sun
you changed my life
well the nature of man is to beg and to steal
i do it myself it's not so unreal
the call of the wild is forever at my door
wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor
but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
from silver and gold to what man cannot hold
you changed my life
i was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
i was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
it all seemed so proper it all seemed so elite
eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet
but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
from silver and gold to what man cannot hold
you changed my life
you were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
while orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
your eyes were on fire your feet were of brass
in the world you had made they made you an outcast
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
from silver and gold to what man cannot hold
you changed my life
there was someone in my body that i could hardly see
invading my privacy making my decisions for me
holding me back not letting me stand
making me feel like a stranger in a strange land
but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
you come down the line give me a new mind
you changed my life
my lord and my savior my companion my friend
heart fixer mind regulator true to the end
my creator my comforter my cause for joy
what the world is set against but will never destroy
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
you came in like the wind like errol flynn
you changed my life
do you love me or are you just extending goodwill
do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt
ive been burned before and i know the score
so you wont hear me complain
will i be able to count on you
or is your love in vain
are you so fast that you cannot see that i must have solitude
when i am in the darkness why do you intrude
do you know my world do you know my kind
or must i explain
will you let me be myself
or is your love in vain
well ive been to the mountain and ive been in the wind
ive been in and out of happiness
i have dined with kings ive been offered wings
and ive never been too impressed
all right ill take a chance i will fall in love with you
if im a fool you can have the night you can have the morning too
can you cook and sew make flowers grow
do you understand my pain
are you willing to risk it all
or is your love in vain
our conversation was short and sweet
it nearly swept me off-a my feet
and im back in the rain oh oh
and you are on dry land
you made it there somehow
youre a big girl now
bird on the horizon sittin on a fence
hes singin his song for me at his own expense
and im just like that bird oh oh
singin just for you
i hope that you can hear
hear me singin through these tears
time is a jet plane it moves too fast
oh but what a shame if all weve shared cant last
i can change i swear oh oh
see what you can do
i can make it through
you can make it too
love is so simple to quote a phrase
youve known it all the time im learnin it these days
oh i know where i can find you oh oh
in somebodys room
its a price i have to pay
youre a big girl all the way
a change in the weather is known to be extreme
but whats the sense of changing horses in midstream
im going out of my mind oh oh
with a pain that stops and starts
like a corkscrew to my heart
ever since weve been apart
ive seen love go by my door
its never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
been shooting in the dark too long
when somethins not right its wrong
yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
dragon clouds so high above
ive only known careless love
its always hit me from below
this time around its more correct
right on target so direct
yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
purple clover queen annes lace
crimson hair across your face
you could make me cry if you dont know
cant remember what i was thinkin of
you might be spoilin me too much love
yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
flowers on the hillside bloomin crazy
crickets talkin back and forth in rhyme
blue river runnin slow and lazy
i could stay with you forever and never realize the time
situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
but theres no way i can compare
all those scenes to this affair
yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
yer gonna make me wonder what im doin
stayin far behind without you
yer gonna make me wonder what im sayin
yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin to
ill look for you in old honolulu
san francisco ashtabula
yer gonna have to leave me now i know
but ill see you in the sky above
in the tall grass in the ones i love
yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna quit me baby
good as i been to you lawd lawd.
good as i been to you lawd lawd.
good as i been to you.
give you my money honey
buy you shoes and clothes lawd lawd.
you're gonna quit me baby
put me outta doors lawd lawd.
six months on the chain gang
believe me it ain't no fun lawd lawd.
day you quit me baby
that's the day you die lawd lawd.
jailhouse ain't no plaything
believe me ain't no lie lawd lawd.
day you quit me baby
that's the day you die lawd lawd.
